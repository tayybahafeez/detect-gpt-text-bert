"So many times have I walked on ruins , the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared , each time I could feel my city , my current generation collapse , break into the black hole that thrives within it , I could feel humanity , the way I 'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years , the pattern became obvious , no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly . <newline> It 's funny , but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long , what I have lived for my entire life , only then , when I achieved immortality I started truly aging . "
" 5 world wars have passed , and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often , I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own , the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells ; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced , a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times , a mechanism that when lost all of which it had , had me loosing my will to live , for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence . "
" Acceptance , something so important . a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times , an ability that looks so easy to achieve , a gift , that I was n't able to aquire in all my years , until now . When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity 's fall , I felt as if all of it 's weight was crushing me . Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope , a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years , the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was . "
" If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy , it can. I ca n't feel my legs , I have walked for days , just to hear the sound of gravel , crushed bones , crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered , the day in my far past . The day of my rebirth , I took out of my pocket a small plastic box , with nine buttons and a small glass window . I could n't believe this was our past , I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet , be destroyed by our own violence  I slowly dialed the number I was given , exactly 1729 years ago . "
" I dropped a tear , a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me . "
" A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me , I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack ... "
" `` You have finally arrived '' He projected into my mind , with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice . "
" `` I 'm ready to obey '' I answered . I knew who was sitting infront of me , and it was time for me to obey him , after all these years of playing god , even I came to it . "
" Funny is n't it ? Even by achieving immortality , death , is inescapable .
-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver , Circa 2023- "
" I walk about the dull gray halls , the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land . Almost . I glance out a window as I pass it by . There 's the sun , and there 's the moon right there . And , of course , there 's the Earth . I kinda miss it . Then again , space is pretty cool . It 's got some brilliant views , and the wifi is surprisingly good . Even countless miles away from the Earth , I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO . "
" I pass by Dale Malkowitz , the head scientist on board . "
" `` Evening , Dale , '' I say . "
" `` What up , Danny ? '' he replies cordially . "
" `` Nothin ' much . A little bored , I guess . '' "
" He shakes his head in disbelief . `` I really , *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space . '' "
" `` Well hey , '' I say slightly defensively , `` Aside from the views , it 's kinda ... dull . And empty . And stuff . '' "
" `` Whatever you say , Wittell , '' he says , not unkindly . Then he walks off . A few moments pass , and then I decide to look out the window right by me . As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ) , I notice something odd about the moon 's surface . It 's slightly ... cracked . "
" `` Hey , Malkowitz ? '' I call out , `` You might wan na check this out ! '' "
" He walks over to me casually , probably expecting nothing . `` What ? '' he asks , `` What do you see ? '' "
 I point at the moon . His brow furrows . `` Huh ... I guess there 's something up with the surface . I 'll have to look into tha- '' 
" Suddenly , the surface cracks a little more . We glance at each other , and then back at the moon , and then at each other again , and then back at the moon again . "
" `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , alarmed . "
" He 's silent for a minute or two , mouth hanging open . Then , he calls out : `` Janice ! Terry ! Johnny ! Get over here ! Something 's up with the moon . '' "
" The other crewmates enter , unsure of what to expect . As their eyes lay upon the moon 's surface cracks , they widen . "
" And , by coincidence , more cracks appear at that very moment . And then more . And more . And more . And more ... "
" Little bits of the moon begin to float away , torn free of the rest of the surface . We all stare , speechless . And then ... it happens . It *happens* . "
 The side of the moon facing us is ... torn away by a ... 
 Human ... hand ? 
 And we see ... 
 A giant ... human face ? ! 
" Surprisingly , I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart . *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face ... from the ... * "
 *Internet . * 
" Suddenly , the great face 's lips move . "
" Of course , none of us can actually *hear* it speak , because of the laws of space and whatnot . However , I can read its lips , and it appears to be saying : "
" `` Are you sure about that ? ''
I was feckin ' sloshed , mate . First time I ever was in the Big Lemon , and I 'd found me the best feckin ' pub I could imagine , I tell ya what . So I stumble out when it was closin ' time , musta been 'round 4 o'clock in the morning , and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I 'd rented for the week . "
" A'course , that 's how many a horror story starts , ainnit ? But it was all fun and games at first . There was this bloke I saw comin ' towards me in the alley , dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead , where the folk were still awake . At least , I thought it was a bloke , but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway . Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason , fecked-up as it all looked , and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery , and wavy like a heat haze comin ' from a welder 's torch . "
" Now this thing must 've been a good foot or five taller 'n me , but sloshed as I am , I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do '' , 'cause I 'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass , y'see ? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine , how about y'self , sir ! '' I feckin ' quite pissed my britches ! More in surprise 'n anythin ' , really , but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass 'm as he walks past me with his long , spindly legs as silvery as the rest of 'm , with his feet makin ' noises like he 's wearin ' cowboy boots with those thingies on 'm . But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub , and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he 's got some fire for me . "
" Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster 'n my eyes can see and says , he says `` sure ! I got your fire here . '' And the feckin ' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself . Devil 's pits , that felt like I was bein ' burnt layer of skin by layer . He sure got me with that . Good feckin ' joke , mate . "
" Must 've been out like a light for ages , but when I woke up , I find myself here . So tell me , Doc : are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study ? 'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one , but I 'd really like to not die , y'know ? What do y'say , wan na go and grab a beer at the pub ?
“ No , no no no ... ” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her . "
" “ Hey ! ” Starting to walk quickly now I picked up my pace until I nearly ran into her . She tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before I grabbed her shoulder . She turned towards me so I could get a clear view of her face . Now I was sure it was her . “ Joanne ? ” Her eyes lit up , if only for a second before she turned back around , grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no ’ s from earlier . "
" “ You can ’ t be here , not now . I finally get this far and now you ’ re here. ” She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point . "
" “ You… you ’ re real , ” I said , looking back to her eyes . “ How… do you know who I am ? ” "
" “ I ’ m real ? Of course I ’ m real ! But you can ’ t be here ! ” Now she was talking directly to me . “ Do you know what kinds of hell you put me through ? The amount of bullying , stress , and endless therapy ! Dave , I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me , ” she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line . "
 “ What are you talking about ? I- ” 
" “ We were best friends , true or false ? ” She asked . "
" “ True , no false , I mean , we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there . “ You ’ re a dream , ” She froze at this . "
" “ No , no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination . I saw you for years ! Every waking moment from- ” "
" “ Seven until twelve ” I looked at her shaking my head , incredulous to what was happening . "
" “ When we fell out of that tree that one summer , ” she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down . "
" “ But that was just a dream , I woke up right after that. ” "
" “ No , that actually happened . I was awake , I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her , and began to realize something . "
" “ You saw me when you were awake , I dreamt you while I was asleep . I lived in Boston , when you lived in Australia. ” "
" “ Hold on , ” She sat down . “ My head hurts , ” She paused . “ We met , every day- ” <newline> “ Night , ” I corrected . She looked at me and scowled . "
" “ Every day . For five years , until we fell . What happened after that ? ” "
" “ I told you , I woke up. ” "
" “ No , what happened for me ? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ” "
" “ Joanne , ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time . “ I woke up. ” <newline>
There 's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep , a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep . As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me , faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM . "
" Unless your plane explodes . Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve , for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness . "
" That 's when I woke up , drenched in sweat , eyes wide with fear and panic . The first thing I noticed was the time . "
 9:35AM 
" It had been so real . It was real . That was no dream , it could n't have been ... "
" I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened . What caused it ? Can we stop it ? Stop the plane , I want to get off ? "
" I 've been a cop for a long time , that 's the good news . "
 The bad ? 
 I 'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone . 
 Especially if I 'm wrong . 
 But what if I 'm right ? 
" No resources , no back-up , no escape . "
" Fuck it , no problem . "
 ***** 
 9:36AM 
 Alright . 
" There 's got to be at least 300 people on board , not including crew . It could be mechanical and it 's going up in flames no matter what and that 's bad news . We 're too far away to do anything about that , the map shows somewhere over the Pacific . "
 That 's really bad . Not like anyone would believe me . 
 I 'm not entirely sure I believe me . 
 My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens . 
" Terrorism ? I mean , I guess it could be but that 's a slim shot in the dark . "
 So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean ? 
 First stop ? Bathroom . Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to ... relieve yourself . 
" That 's when I see her . I stand and she 's further back but she 's got that look on her face . The sweat , the panic . She saw it too . "
 The good ? I guess I have a partner . 
 The bad ? I might not be wrong . 
 **** 
 9:37AM 
 I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms . 
 `` You saw it ? '' 
 She nodded . 
 `` Did you see anything ? '' 
 She shook her head . 
" This was n't productive . There had to be something , some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful . Then something clicked . "
 `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from ? '' 
 She tilted her head as if she was remembering . 
" `` Yeah , the heat was in front of me . What the hell is going on ? '' "
" I looked back to the passengers . There were six rows between her seat and mine . Six rows of nine , that 's ... 54 if any math from school stuck . "
" `` Hey , did you hear me ? '' She said , grabbing my arm . "
 `` Yeah ! It came from in front of you . It came from behind me . So that means- '' 
" `` It started somewhere between us . '' She finished , which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick . "
 I checked my watch . 
 9:41AM . 
 We were running out of time . 
 **** 
 9:42AM 
" `` Does anyone stick out to you ? '' she whispered and I shook my head . We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination . A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem , the elderly couple as well . Stuff like that . "
 As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously . 
 One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently . 
 A younger man sweating profusely . 
 A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion . 
 I pointed them out to her and she agreed . So maybe we had three suspects . Or maybe we had three nervous flyers . 
 9:45AM . 
 Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start . 
 As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind . 
" She startled both of us and that 's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me . Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew . She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment . That 's when I
The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior . It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion . `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet , '' he thought . `` I shall wake him , soon enough . '' He strode forward , heavily , in his iron raiment , shining dully in the morning sun . The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky , mirroring the Warrior 's toil this day as the last . The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds . "
" For generations the people had not seen it wake . But their stories , told by night and hearth fire , still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath . Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed . But that was before . Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will . Now they had weapons that could fight the myth . That could quench the fire . "
" The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank , just as the sun had stopped there hours before . He breathed . Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands . A glow had appeared within the clouds . The mountain rumbled . "
" `` I have come to wake you , beast , and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you . '' The ground rolled and thundered . He roared in defiance and raised his axe , charging into the fog . He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears . The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently . "
" A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination . The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond . Without breaking stride , the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt , axe raised high , into a pit of Dragon fire .
I open my eyes in a panic , sweat beading and then falling down my face . I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment . Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before , but there is a heavy , unfamiliar air in the room . I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground , and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink . I was alone last night like I always am , I think . No one has been here but me in over three months . "
" I 'm not allowed to think about it much longer , as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night , slowly worsening . I pinch my eyes shut , knowing what 's coming next , and for just one moment , as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break , I think I may just die this time . And just as quickly , the wave reaches the shore , and I know I have a few moments of peace . I open my eyes and look around . I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments , and I drift to an uneasy sleep , as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body , dissipating into the small space I call home . "
" The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it . The pain blinds me , numbing me to all feeling and sensation . The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily . "
" I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while . I open my eyes and , fighting the blinding lights and white room , I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights . Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before , looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to . The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position , only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away . "
" The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong , though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years . The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders , though they seemed more ashen now . Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me , and I recall the day in my childhood where , in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder , I fell and scrapped my knee . And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position . And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace . "
" And just as I begin to reach out , I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach . Falling in and out of consciousness , I see quick flashes . I see my mother 's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held . I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather , bowing and shaking their heads , unsure . I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance . And I see a sign , sloppily and quickly written above my bed , the only writing visible to me in my haze . It read `` Patient Zero '' .
“ Sadie ! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm ! ” "
" My mom frantically dialed 911 , as I laid there , shocked . Literally . "
 “ Hello ? ! My daughter was just struck- “ 
" All of a sudden , something was wrong . I sat up , my fingertips crackling with this new power . Or was it the aftermath of the lighting ? I couldn ’ t tell . Nor did I care . No . Something was definitely wrong , and it was nearby . "
" “ If I take 295 south right now , I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat . And then I can finally build that deck you ’ ve wanted , they have the planks on sale . I can feel it in my blood . Now , I know , they ’ re plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine , but hear me out here . Plum is the pinest color out there , and you ’ d be a birch to say otherwise. ” "
" My mom looked back at me , a hint of recognition in her eyes , but the rest of her face read as one emotion : terror . "
" “ You know what else ? I ’ m gon na get like , 50 windows from craigslist , they have the best deals , and make a greenhouse ! ” "
" Somehow , the words kept spilling out of my mouth . But something else was off here . Something with my house… "
" Suddenly , I knew . I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage . I jumped up the rest of the way , and dashed the two blocks to my house , where my brother ’ s laptop was . "
" “ Not . Home . And his computer is plugged in . ENERGY WASTER ! Doesn ’ t he care about this house ? ! He could ’ ve burned the whole place down ! ” <newline>
I do n't want to cut off his head , but I do n't really have a choice . I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over . My insides turn as I feel the swing connect . "
 *Quit being so weak ! You 've done this before . * 
" The jock 's girlfriend screams on cue , looks like she is going to faint . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . I see how scared she is , and I feel ashamed . I 'm not the bad guy . "
 *Do I have to remind you ? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things ? They are trespassing ! * 
" The door to the bedroom bursts open , and another girl storms in . I think her name was Whitney . She is holding a shovel . She surveys the scene , and I am impressed by how calm she seems . I decide to back off , but she takes that as a sign to attack . The shovel strikes me in the face , knocking my mask off . Before I can recover , I am hit again . Then a third time . The fourth strike sends me flying out the window . We are currently three stories high . "
 *How could you let her do that ? * 
" I like the feeling of being weightless . Bits of shattered glass encompass me , sparkling with moonlight . I feel like I 'm floating in space , surrounded by stars . Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break . I shift to make sure . "
 *Mother fucker ! * 
 Yeah ... it broke . 
" I landed in a pile of bushes , which cushioned my fall at least somewhat . Through the thick tangle of branches , I look up toward the broken window . Whitney is nervously peering out of it , scanning the grounds . "
 `` He 's gone . '' she shouts before disappearing back into the house . 
" *You need to get up . They are getting away . If they get away , they will tell others . More people will come . Not just the shitty teenagers , either . For fuck 's sake , GET UP ! * "
" I know I have some time , so I take a moment to collect my thoughts . I do n't like doing this : hurting people . It 's better now that I 'm numb to it . It 's not my fault they keep coming here . It 's not my fault he makes me hurt them . I 'm not the bad guy . "
" From the other side of the house , I hear the front door open , followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel . "
" `` Keep it together , Cindy . I need you to keep it together '' Whitney 's voice is stern but supportive . "
" Though she does n't speak , Cindy 's breathing begins to steady . "
" I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open . In the next few seconds , they will drive off , and I can go back to being alone . "
 *Except their car wo n't start . You saw to that . * 
" The engine begins to hang , and I hear the girls swearing . They keep trying , but it 's no use . "
" He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to . He makes me run despite the pain in my side . The girls scream as soon as I round the corner . They throw open their car doors and begin to flee . He tries to make me chase them , but I refuse . "
" *If you ca n't do what needs doing , fine . I 'll do it ! * "
" I am too weak to fight him . He takes control of me , one limb at a time , and everything fades . "
" When I wake up , I am in the woods . It is almost pitch black , but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance . I start walking toward it , but my foot catches on something , almost knocking me over . I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me . She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds . Some of the diamonds are red now . I try not to think about her again as I continue walking . "
" As I approach the cabin door , something triggers in the back of my mind . I feel isolated , safe . The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside . "
" There are pictures covering the walls , drawings of spaceships and planets and stars . I look closer and find that each picture has something in common : a drawing of a boy with a space helmet . He looks happy . I find something else , too : a photograph . "
" This one is of also of a boy , a real one . He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head , cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings . He is n't alone , though ; there is a man standing behind him . His face has been drawn over in a furious series
For years we had been warned . <newline> Since the 40 's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us . <newline> Nutjobs we called them , conspiracy theorists . "
" It was supposed to be a day of celebration , the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed 'unionists ' . <newline> It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike . "
" Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony , when our newly elected president 'Dave Johnson ' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true , reptilian face . <newline> `` Sstupid little monkeyss . We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess . Now , it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss ! '' <newline> Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked . <newline> Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd . <newline> `` Do NOT ressisst uss ! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss ! we have replaced every leader ! We have-.. '' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom . "
" `` Anthony , what iss that ? ! what iss going on ? ! ! '' <newline> Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd . <newline> The reptiles , not knowing what to , simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky . "
" The creature that appeared tall , sleek and had grey , almost silverish skin . <newline> 'Organics of Joo'el . We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance . This process involves destroying your planet , thus killing you , sorry . ' <newline> `` You have got to be sshitting me ! , I 've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss ! ! '' "
" 'Defecation is irrelevant , local warlord . ' "
 `` That'ss not what it meanss ! ! '' <newline> Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky . 
 `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen ! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory ! You silver spoon ! ! '' 
" 'Consent is irrelevant , local warlord . Gobal distribution achived , commencing planetary modifications , please remain calm . ' "
" The silver chariots , seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants , began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams . <newline> Seconds later , an earthquake hit , and something surfaced with it . <newline> Most chariots managed to dodge in time , but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth . <newline> The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes . <newline> At their full height , they were at least 30 storys tall . <newline> Every chariot retreated to a safer distance . "
 `` The fuck iss thiss ? ! ! '' 
" 'Reproduction is irrelevant , local warlord . ' "
 `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD ! ! ! '' 
 A bellowing voice shook the ground . Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears . 
" { We have lain dormant for aeons . We have waited , we have awoken . } "
 'We must utilise this planet to- ' 
 `` WE KNOW ! ! ! '' 
 { We have waited for- } 
 `` I DO N'T CARE ! ! ! '' 
" Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground . More than that , anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales . "
" `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss ! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware , or dirtpiles , or anything elsse ! ! '' "
" Just as Dave had finished , a rift in space above him opened , allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing . <newline> The spaceship , no bigger than a small car , was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head . "
 { Oh oh } 
" 'Oh no , an Arbiter has arrived . ' "
 `` The fuck iss an Arbiter ? ! '' 
 'Reproduction is still irrelevant . ' 
" `` SSHUT UP ! ! ! ''
Note : I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and have n't read any of the books , so I do n't know what happens after that . Please no spoilers ! This is also my first WP post , but constructive feedback is welcome . Also , just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format , hence the weird capitalization . "

" Fade in to a mound of swords , tips facing us . We hear footsteps on stone , slowly getting closer . Meanwhile , the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne . Camera sweeps around the throne , until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne , face blank . "
" After several seconds , in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester 's chain . Both sounds then stop , and we hear an aged but familiar voice , `` Your Grace ... '' "
" The camera turns to face SAM , in full maester garb . We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds , and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs . DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops . "
" Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head . To her right stands SIR JORAH , after all these years , he 's still protectively looking over her . The Hand of the King 's medallion hangs from his armor . "
" SAM : I 've just received word from The Wall . It 's still holding , but they do n't think it 'll hold much longer . Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice . "
" DAENARYS : What do you advise , Grand Meister ? Can we do anything ? "
" SAM : Not yet , but I 've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known . I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves ... "
" A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face , almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words . "
 SAM : ... blood magic . 
" DAENARYS : As protector of the realm , I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers . You must seek the RED WOMAN at once , perhaps she knows of this text . "
" JORAH , disapprovingly : Khaleesi ... "
" DAENARYS : I hope to not need it . But if the wall may be breached , we must be prepared . In the meantime , my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone , and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements . And Jorah , you must stop calling me that . I am ... "
" She stands , the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background , growing louder until the end of her sentence . "
" DAENARYS , thundering : Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn , Queen of The Seven Kingdoms , Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm . "
" Still facing her , we hear "
" JORAH and SAM ( in unison ) : Yes , my queen . "

" We see a green , lush , almost idyllic island at dusk . The sea is an unusually bright blue , which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake , The Sapphire Isle . This is Tarth . "
" The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach . A woman stands in front of them , a sword fighting teacher . The camera continues upwards . We see a small castle , with a balcony over the field . Two figures sit on the balcony , indistinguishable . The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand . "
" Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below . They are both old , in their fifties . We can still make out JAMIE 's unadulterated good looks , and BRIENNE still ... not so much . But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment 's notice . They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury . "
" We hear in the distance , and from JAMIE and BRIENNE 's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind . "
" ARYA : Alright , that 's it for today . And remember , what do we say to Death ? "
 CHILDREN ( in unison ) : NOT TODAY ! 
 The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements . 
" ARYA : Now inside , it 's getting dark . "
" The children drop their swords and run to the castle . ARYA sighs and collects the swords . She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed . Through the window , we see Needle , framed and mounted on her office wall . How did she end up here , doing this ? She would never know . "
 Fade to next scene .

" I had to stop here today , but I have an idea for the storyline which I 'd like
He sat back in the chair , looking at the monitors behind me . Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height , all screens showed employees working . I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles , all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly . "
 *What a controlling bastard . * 
" I was here for a contract job , working only for tax season . The owner said that would give me the place of honor right outside the office window that overlooked the cube farm . *Place of honor , my ass . * "
" `` I 've decided that the best way to verify that a potential employ will -- '' he paused and steepled his fingers in font of his chin , like a smug villain in a cartoon , `` -- fit in , is to give them a personality test . Do you have time to do that ? '' "
" I wanted to tell him where to shove it because there was no way I wanted to work for him , but instead I nodded eagerly . `` I 've done those before . Sure . '' "
 `` This test is put out by a group that specializes in management . '' He named a certain religious group that I knew valued subservience . `` They 're the ones who score it and then send me back the results . Not a lot of people pass it . '' 
" *Just great . * I nodded and smiled like a bobble-head . God , this was getting old . "
" He handed me the test , told me it was timed , and watched me like a hawk while I filled in the little bubbles . I did n't answer honestly , as he 'd insisted , but instead drew from my knowledge of what the religious group valued . Test complete , he smiled smugly and told me that he 'd get it scored and let my recruiter know if he wanted to proceed . "
 I had n't even gotten home before my recruiter called . `` I do n't believe it ! I 've sent him fifteen people and no one has passed the personality test ! He wants to make you an offer . '' 
" I laughed . `` I 'm going to decline , Bob . '' ( His name really is Bob . ) "
 Bob was shocked . `` But he wants to offer you a job . '' 
 I explained that I lied on the test . That I 'd known he was looking for a blind follower and that was n't me . I 'd just passed the exam to see if I could . 
" Bob fell silent , mulling over my statement . `` So , if I was going to tell someone how to pass the test , what should I tell them ? '' "
 `` Tell them he wants blind obedience and they should taylor their answers to that . Tell them he 's going to watch them constantly and probably counts the pens every night to make sure they do n't steal any . '' 
" `` Oh , '' Bob grunted . `` Sound like the job , if they got it , would really suck . '' "
 *No kiddin . * `` Find me something else Bob . '' 
" It 's three years later and Bob told me recently that he still has never found anyone who wanted to work for the guy .
`` Disengaging from primary module . Do you copy ? '' "
" `` Copy , Solo 1 . Confirm separation . '' "
 `` Separation complete . '' 
" `` Looks good . Ready when you are , Commander . '' "
 `` Roger that . Engaging thrusters . '' 
" Gazing upon the comet , Commander Harrison felt consumed by his awareness of its gravitational pull as he had for many months in this mission . Everything had centered around this grand celestial meeting . Now finally up close , the comet looked more lovely than he had imagined . The pull was so much stronger now , defying his most basic fears . Those deadly gaseous streams whirled off the comet 's surface , in a dance both beautiful and terrifying . "
" Harrison 's approach was precise and controlled . Thrusters on full , his craft shuddered through clouds of fine carbon capable of eroding its metal skin . As he approached the thin atmosphere of the comet , he had to swerve to avoid a hail of icy projectiles the size of golf balls . The maneuver drew him toward the comet 's sunlit side , where more gaseous jets bubbled through the comet 's surface . Suddenly the sun blazed golden through his screens , blinding him for the instant before his eyes snapped shut . He eased back on the throttle and snapped the shielding visor of his helmet into place . "
 `` Mission Control to Solo 1 . Report ! '' 
 `` Sorry Mission Control . Holding back a little . '' 
 `` Problems ? '' 
 `` Could n't maintain a visual . Making course corrections now . Rendezvous to Comet Ellie is still on . '' 
" `` Proceed Solo 1 . Be careful , Toby . '' "
 `` Copy that MC . '' 
" The renewed approach called for a more risky trajectory . Harrison focused all his thoughts on the dark side of the comet , imagining a cool , welcoming surface . He plunged the craft into an approaching dust plume , shielding him from the sun but leaving him blind to any hidden dangers . The recklessness of the course set in familiar feelings of panic as the craft shook and rolled but he fought the urge to pull away . Not this time , he promised himself as clouds of stormy grey billowed past the window . Hold on , he thought . Remember the gravity . Remember the pull . "
" And then he was through . The comet 's rocky surface loomed large before him and it was glorious in its perfection . He slammed the attitudinal controls , setting the landing sequence a little aggressively in his haste to join the surface . Outside he could see a chunk of hailstone shoot up past his window , and emerge into the broad sunlight where it condensed into a single clear teardrop . He turned away , his attention back on the surface . "
 * 
" The teardrop coursed its way down her cheek . Ellie Harrison did n't dare look Toby in the eye for fear of breaking the moment . Her 8-year old son held her in an embrace that was surprisingly strong . Standing across the room , Toby 's father looked as stunned as she felt . She could read the elation in David 's face , and a reflection of her own longing for this very moment . Closing her eyes to the torrent of feelings that overwhelmed her , she managed to hold perfectly still . Her son was hugging her for the very first time . That was enough . "
"
General Bolden made his way to the antechamber , as he had done twice before . He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing , just as his predecessors recalled tales of `` The Revelation '' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration . It began as a dare , something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program . If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator , they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President 's in-brief . Something in private , very secret , plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting . "
" It was largely forgotten by all who made it up , until Jim Fletcher remembered a funny story he had heard at a Christmas party a few years ago . He saw who Nixon 's successor would be , figured Gerry Ford had a sense of humor , and gave it a shot . What he did n't expect was that President Ford would buy it hook , line , and sinker . To save NASA the embarrassment , he quickly had official reports drawn up with shaky physics to explain why millennia of accepted science was wrong , and why it had to be kept a secret from the community at large . "
" Over the years , it became a tradition , part of the President-Elect 's initiation into the country 's highest office . Most of them figured that with that much technobabble , it had to be true , though a few struggled with it . After Jimmy Carter was elected , there was some concern , as he had sailed around the world in his Navy days . The physicists cooked up a line about gravitational lensing near the edge of the earth causing ships to imperceptibly turn away , and Carter took it as truth . Reagan laughed it off , H.W . ignored it , and Clinton believed it all . Their next concern came in 2001 , when Senator Glenn let an old colleague know that President Bush had been asking about it . After savoring the mortified look on Mr. Goldin 's face , the Senator let him know that he was one of the young astronauts who came up with the joke in the first place . "
" Even with the years of tradition behind it , it was still a nervous time for the Administrator . To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse , risk losing funding for NASA . Still , there were certain things that just had to be done . Certain rituals to be observed , for old time 's sake . "
" General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before : `` Mr. President , could we please speak in private ? ''
I 'm really not sure why I took this job . I have family members who are retired Aurors . They view me with a mix of shame and despair . I 've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters , and they feel the same way . "
" I may not be the black sheep of the family , thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters , but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners . "
" Oh well , fuck them . I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells . "
" Why am I near Iceland ? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks . Highly volatile spells come out of my research . The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good . As the son of decorated Aurors , I was able to get the job pretty easily . My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill . "
" Also , as my former supervisor said , `` I 'm one crazy son of a bitch . '' "
" He 's my former supervisor because one day , working on a teleportation spell , he vanished . His whereabouts are unknown , but there are rumors that he 's using his magic to great success in Vegas , hustling blackjack . "
 I always liked that guy . 
" Now , I 'm the boss . I have a new recruit . Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts , who takes everything way too seriously . I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work . Between the remote location and the dangers of our work , he 's ripe to crack up . "
" `` So , what are we working on today ? '' the Kid asks . "
" `` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures , just in case the Old Ones rise . '' "
" `` But , but , my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again . '' "
" `` You 're not at Hogwarts anymore , the stars could be right at any moment , then we all could be shit out of luck . '' "
" I have to remind the kid of that a lot . He 's still wearing his robes , looking like he 's about to go to some damn Potions lecture . Meanwhile , I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow '' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department . They have nice toys in Texas . "
" `` So , what 's our first spell going to be ? '' "
" `` Special banishment spell , '' I reply . `` One to cross over dimensional walls . '' "
" No wizard , even that Potter guy , could singlehandedly banish an Old One . But if enough talented wizards got involved , the spell might have a chance . Might . "
 The Kid did n't need to know that part . 
" `` There 's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors , '' I continue . `` Did you watch the presentation ? '' "
" `` Yes , I did . Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` "
 I shake my head . Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students . 
" `` Okay , we 're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches . Let 's make sure you 've got the basic spell down before we continue . '' "
" `` Alright , '' he replies "
" `` Remember : right arm fully extended , off to the side . Swing it in a controlled motion across your body . '' "
" `` I got you , '' he says , a little more confident than I like . Damn Gryffindors are always like that . "
 `` What 's the activation phrase ? '' 
" `` Piercus Four , '' he answers . "
" `` Good , let 's see you do it . '' "
" The kid steps over to the other side of the room . As soon as he goes into the motion , I know it has gone to shit . He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast . Before I can yell for him to stop , the fateful words come from his mouth . "
 `` Piercus Four ! '' 
 The space around him blurs . By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself . My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes . 
 The Kid is gone . 
 Shit . 
" Now I have to go find him .
Bill slammed the empty shotglass upside down on the counter . `` Seriously ! They never talk about how much ... Ummm ... Paperwork ! Yeah ! And shouting ! They never mention that in the pamphlet ! '' He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf . After uncapping the top , the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand . The counter bobbed down slowly as Bob dropped the bag on it . `` I signed up to go see the sights and meet new cultures ! Not to get stuck in an office signing contracts and making ads ! Paper after paper after- ugh- paper ... Meeting the president even gets boring after the 20th time ! So many questions that we had answered in our report months ago ! You never realize how much people do n't read until you do something abnormal . They always want to ask the same question but hear the answer from you ! '' "
 Bill had forgotten that he was still holding the glass and his angry arm waving sent tiny orbs of the green liquid onto uniform of the person next to him . Aweah'jebe did n't notice though . His head was thumping and he was slumped over on the counter . He made a series of gurgling and clicking noises . From a band around his neck came a humming and then the translated message : 
 `` I know what you mean ! Even here ! Our overlords- burp- put tons of pressure on us . We have n't even left our own planet ! We 've just been chilling here entertaining you . We 're a welcoming committee ! It 's a good time going out and drinking and picking up girls but- '' 
" `` Yeah ! Despite the gills , the green skin , and the really big eyes , the girls here are pretty dang good looking ! '' "
" `` Oh yeah , definitely . Just wait until they legalize cross-species marriage ! Your gravity is so much worse . You can do crazy things here . I ca n't imagine doing it with a girl so heavy and so slowly ... Ummm ... What was I- Oh right ! What I do n't understand is how- ugh- you 're drinking me under the table so easily ! '' "
" `` Probably that dang gravity again . Alcohol just floods in and out on Earth . Here , the alcohol chills in your blood for such a long time ! Your kidneys barely have the work and the good times last so much longer ! Which reminds me : Here is another shot ! ''
Akron returned to his room , another day gone and he was no closer to finding work . He was a good swordsman , but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one . He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over . As it was , he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment . He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his 'soldier 's honor ' stretch . "
" <newline> He had nearly gone to bed when there was a knock at his door . He opened it to find an empty walkway . He stepped out to look down into the tavern and saw no one rushing for the door . When he turned back to his room he saw a note just on the other side of his door . It read , `` Akron , Meet at King 's Fountain . I have work . - Pitch . '' Akron folded the note . Pitch had never been a brave man in the company , but he was the most resourceful . What he lacked in holding the line he more than made up for in his scrounging after the line no longer needed to be held , most of which he kept for himself . "
 -- - 
" Akron waited at King 's Fountain as the letter asked . A chill swept through the empty square and he wished he had brought his coat . The hairs on his neck pricked when he heard a set of footsteps approaching . `` Akron old boy , '' a voice called , `` I did n't think you 'd come . '' He held his arms out wide . "
" <newline> Akron turned , `` You were right to think so , '' he replied , keeping his hands in his pockets . "
" <newline> `` C'mon sarge , '' Pitch goaded , `` Is that any way to greet an old man-at-arms . '' "
" <newline> `` As I recall , your arm stayed sheathed more often than not , '' Akron said back , a hint of bitterness coloring his words . If Pitch was disappointed he did not show it . `` You said you had work , '' he laid down his cards . They were not and had never been friends , but the promise of work bought Pitch a meeting . "
" <newline> `` Alright , '' Pitch said , slumping a little , `` I work with one of the Mage Schools . '' "
" <newline> Akron waved his hand , `` No , '' he said , `` No thank you , I 'll have none of that . '' "
" <newline> Pitch raised his palms , `` Please , Sarge , just hear me out . '' Akron shook his head , but then nodded . `` They just need some muscle , Sarge . You do n't got to do anything , you do n't got to say anything . You just need to be in the room to make my guys look tougher than they are . '' "
" <newline> `` Tougher ? '' Akron spat , remembering the power the wizards wielded during the war . Some nights he could still see the crawling embers on his men when the enemy Fire Schools unleashed their power on his lines . `` Why would they need to look any more dangerous than they are ? '' "
" <newline> `` Sarge , it 's just a power play . This school 's not a big one , they just need to bring up their numbers a bit at the meeting , '' Pitch said , shrugging his shoulders . "
" <newline> `` What meeting ? '' Akron asked , squinting at the scoundrel . "
" <newline> Pitch shook his head , `` I should n't even be telling you this , '' he said as his eyes widened . "
 <newline> `` Talk . '' 
" <newline> `` They want a seat at the Mage 's Circle , '' he said , `` Something big is about to happen in the city , and they want a part of it when it all goes down . No one 's taking them seriously because they do n't got the numbers . '' "
" <newline> `` So what ? '' Akron asked , `` You add to them one guy who ca n't use magic ? '' "
" <newline> `` Not just one , Sarge , '' Pitch said already starting to wince , `` I got some of the other guys from the company . '' "
" <newline> `` Gods on high , Pitch , '' Akron sighed , `` All of them ? '' "
" <newline> `` No , Sarge , not all of them . Some of the boys did n't want no part of this . Still shaky from the Mage Fire . You remember do n't ya Sarge ? '' "
 <newline> Akron nodded and clenched his jaw . 
" <newline> `` I 'll pay you standard plus what I would have paid the other guys , '' Pitch said , `` It wo n't work without you , Sarge . You got ta get them back in line , whip them up , look impressive . The mages I work with will take care of the rest . '' "
" <newline> Akron began to shake his head , but his stomach grumbled loud . A hint of a smile crept across Pitch 's mouth . ``
`` Who here has been in an aDAM attack ? '' I said , addressing the college audience . I was glad I was here , giving my account of the aDAM attacks . It was a good job ; I sacrificed too damn much for this world , and it had given me little in return . Being a touring guest lecturer across the world was a dream come true . "
" Two kids raised their hands in the fact . The girl looked like she was about to fall asleep , but the guy poked her with a cane-yes , a someone still used a *cane* in 2112 . The guy also raised his hand , his face grinning broadly . It really made me want to smack it right off . "
" `` Interesting . There 's at least 300 , no , 500 students in this lecture hall ? Usually , I get a lot more . I 'm sorry . I apologize for not doing my duty as a U.N. soldier . Civilian casualties have been rising over the recent aDAM Encounters . Let us have a moment of silence and pray for all the students who could not make it here today . '' "
" And then there was that moment of silence . After lowering my head for the smallest of tilts , I opened my eyes early to find those same two kids looking at me . The girl looked bored , and the guy looked like he was trying his hardest crack up silently . It looked like he was having a spasm . "
" `` You . Girl with the auburn hair and guy with the cane . Get up here , '' I demanded . The girl looked annoyed-did she have resting bitch face or something ? -and elbowed the guy , who could n't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing . The rest of the auditorium was quiet as the duo made their way forwards . It made the cane 's impacts with the floor that much louder . "
" `` You two are also U.N. soldiers , are n't you ? Cains ? '' "
" `` Eh ? Yeah , how did you know ? '' the girl said , looking surprised . "
" `` Arrogant brats , '' I growled . `` Stop lying . First of all , even if you were Cains , you 're not a soldier yet . You two are still students . '' "
" `` Well , duh , we 're students in a college auditorium ... '' "
" `` Do n't give me that attitude , '' I snarled . I wanted to slap her face . In fact , the guy 's too . He gave up standing and was rolling around on the floor . "
" I put an arm proudly on my black uniform . `` I am a U.N. soldier , part of the 82nd generation . I have fought in the previous 12th aDAM Encounter , when the aDAMs decimated Paris and terrorized everyone in France . I was pinned to the ground for hours when the level of the Gravity Field surpassed everybody 's expectations . Do you know how hard it is to be helpless , unable to move ? I only survived because I drank the rainwater that sipped into my mouth . I could n't do anything as the aDAMs stepped onto my fellow soldiers and brothers . And you , *you* have the gall to pretend to be U.N . soldiers ? ! ? You have not been in my situation ! Have you been bragging to your friends that you 're one of the lucky few to be Cains , defenders of humanity ? Do n't make me laugh . You 're sad , pitiful , human beings . '' "
" This time , the girl also began cracking up . `` Ooooh boy , '' she giggled . `` This guy is really a looner . '' "
" Then the guy finally began to speak . `` Please dude , stop speaking . You 're embarrassing us . A true Cain never talks about past aDAM Encounters they 've been in . They 're too traumatizing . '' "
" `` Too traumatizing for spoiled kids like *you* , I presume . And what about this ? '' I said , clasping my uniform . `` Where are yours ? Let me guess . They were somehow vaporized by the aDAMs , leaving you barely alive to tell the tale ? '' "
" `` Wow , how did you guess ? '' the guy said , raising his eyebrows . "
" `` I think mine 's in the laundry , '' the girl said . She had a pinky in her ear , digging around for some earwax or something . Again , it made me want to tear their heads off . `` Who 's dead body did you get yours from ? '' "
" `` Enough . Have an arm wrestle contest with me , '' I growled , lying down on the ground . "
 `` Arm wrestle contest ? '' they both said simultaneously . Then they both began laughing again . 
" `` It is below me to use violence , '' I said . `` But I need to teach either of you to learn your places in front of a true Cain . '' "
" `` Sure . Jenn , you got this , '' the guy said . The girl sighed , but also laid down . "
" I 'll concede . I was not actually a Cain . The boy was correct ; I looted the uniform off a corpse . But the experience was true .
The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth . Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room , gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them . They 'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet 's bounty had come . He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture . Beside him , his second barked out the orders . All around him , subordinates scurried around , beginning the assault . Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons . The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere . The acid would vaporize , but then , when it rained , it would rain acid . All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient . "
 Hatu was not _this_ patient . They 'd been raining acid on the planet for weeks . Still the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and beg mercy . He 'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae . That he could plunder their lands to his fill . Why did the humans not cry for succor ? 
 A subordinate bowed low before him . Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed . 
" `` Sir , '' the subordinate said , shaking in fear but admirably keeping the tremor out of his voice , `` our attack is failing . We are running low on ammunition . '' "
 `` What ! '' Hatu roared . There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice . `` How is this possible ? '' 
" The subordinate looked down now , too cowed to meet Hatu 's eyes . Hatu glowered at him . `` You will answer my question , scum . '' "
" `` Sir , '' the subordinate said , voice barely above a whisper , `` the earthlings . They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison . '' "
" `` In fact , many people have been collecting it in large urns , '' another voice piped up somewhere behind him . "
" Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him , looking to him for guidance , but all he could think was , `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans , if they could so boldly drink that , what use was any of their weapons ? '' <newline>
Janice turned to me , her big blue eyes still full of childish innocence . Damn - I 'd forgotten that she was watching the Presidential Inauguration for a school project . `` Daddy , '' she began , `` what does the President mean ? What 's 'gay ' ? '' "
" `` Well , honey ... '' I began , but trailed off as I tried to think of a way to explain it to a five year old . `` Uh ... Well , you know how Mommy and Daddy like to hold hands , and to cuddle , and kiss , and stuff ? '' "
" `` Yeah ! It 's funny when Mommy pinches your butt when you 're not looking , and makes you squeak ! '' she giggled . Kids , man - I 'd forgotten what it was like to be so amused by the word `` butt '' . Had I ever been that small , that innocent ? "
" I waited for her giggles to subside before I carried on . `` Well , sweetheart , 'gay ' means that he - the President - he likes to do that stuff with a boy , not a girl like Mommy . '' "
" I could see the confusion in her eyes as she struggled to process this new information . Damn you , McCain , for making me explain this to her ! She 's not old enough for this ; she 's not ready ! *I'M* not ready ! <newline> Janice opened her mouth to speak . I knew what was coming ; I 'd opened the door to a lifetime of sexual deviancy . My sweet little girl was gone forever . "
" Suddenly I realized she 'd something , and in my worry , I 'd completely missed it . `` Sorry , sweetheart - what did you say ? '' I asked , fearing her response . What fresh hell have I unlocked ? "
" `` I said , I 'm hungry . Can I have a cookie ? Please , Daddy ? '' "
" I was stunned , unable to respond at first . <newline> `` Uhm . Sure , '' I answered . `` Get one for your brother , too . '' "
" Huh . I guess that maybe what two consenting adults do behind closed doors is n't that big of a deal after all . <newline> Even when they *are* public figures .
Gieta sat in the field near her house surrounded by daisies and sweet-grass , weaving the two together in absent boredom . This place used to be her favorite place . It was a place where any adventure could happen , where any story from the imagination of an eight year old girl could and would come to life . Not any longer though . The grass seemed dull . The flowers seemed listless . How dreary it was . She did n't want to be there anymore . Gietas train of thought was cut off from the sound of footsteps striding through the grass . "
" `` Uncle Brathe ! '' She exclaimed , glad to see someone who would help relieve her problem of nothing to do . Uncle Brathe was always a favorite . If Uncle Brathe did n't have a good story to tell ( which he always did ) or if he did n't bring sweets with him ( which he always did ) or if he did n't pick her up and rub his bearded cheek against hers ( may the powers forbid ! ) he would still be her favorite . He still remembers how to play . As she ran to meet him , her Uncle lifted her off the ground and greeted her as he always did . "
" `` Uncle , where have you been ? You have not visited me for weeks now ! '' "
" `` I know Darlin ' , I know . Your old Uncle has been busy . '' "
" `` I wished for you to visit every day and you never came . But now that you 're here , we can play ! '' Her Uncle set her down , and as he did the cheerful demeanor diminished . He crouched down beside her in the over bearing shade of the orchard . "
 `` Actually Darlin ' I thought we could just talk for a bit . '' Gietas face scrunched up . Her parents had been talking to her an awful lot lately . About how she spends too much of her time dreaming of things . She did n't see the problem . 
" `` Did my Mom tell you to do this ? '' She asked , feeling slightly betrayed . "
" `` No sweet pea , she did n't . I have n't visited your Mom in a long time because she still has n't forgiven me and you know how upset she gets when she sees me . '' Uncle Brathe started weaving dead sweet grass together as he continued . `` You need to understand darlin ' that the things you can do when you 're asleep is a rare gift that many others ca n't do , nor can they comprehend what it is like . '' He set aside the grass , and reached for leaves on the saggy tree . `` I understand though , because that 's exactly what I used to do and look how I ended up . '' Geita went to speak but he stopped her . "
" `` I know it 's like godhood described in the old tomes , to be an ultimate creator but the problem is that you are not a God of the Beginning . You are a sweet little girl with freckles . You must feed your dreams with the experience of life . '' He stood and picked up a dried up stick , as a knight would draw his sword . "
" `` Do you remember when we saved the village from the Shadow Breathers ? You learned those sword tricks from your Father . '' He slashed the air with his stick . `` Or what about the time you wove a web so great that we lifted the Ocean King to the surface so he could see his own childrens wedding ? Your mother taught you to weave , you know . '' Gieta picked up a stick of her own and swatted at her Uncle . "
" `` Well ya , but real life is so boring ! I ca n't control anything around me and I have to do everything that everyone else says . '' They weaved in and out of the lack luster orchard sparring back and forth . "
" `` If you do n't live a little now and again darlin , eventually the dreams will get just as boring . The color will slowly start fading , and the adventure becomes a routine . Life is what creates dreams , not the other way around . '' The thought stopped Gieta as she lunged with her substitute sword . "
" `` What did you do then , Uncle ? When your dreams became gray and still ? '' "
" `` I blamed the waking world . I cursed it for lacking everything I had once been able to do in my thoughts . But I was wrong , sweet Gieta . I was so wrong . What I did in the name of dreaming was unforgivable . '' They had stopped sword fighting now and held each others gaze for a long moment . A breeze drifted through , much colder than normal . "
" `` I think I understand , Uncle . I will try to feed my dreams , but it sounds terribly hard . '' Uncle Brathe kneeled in front of Gieta . "
 `` It is my dear . It 's very hard and very important that you start as soon as you can . '' 
" `` Ok Uncle . I promise I 'll try . As soon as I wake up . ''
`` By the thousand teeth of Scrolith , Simon , it 's *hiss , roar , roar , claw ! * '' <newline> The basilisk looked crestfallen , <newline> `` Sorry . Thought it was hiss , claw , roar roar . '' <newline> I sighed through my long-dead teeth , <newline> `` How many months have we been rehearsing this ? '' <newline> Simon 's tail lashed sullenly . <newline> * '' How many ? `` * <newline> He mumbled something unintelligible . <newline> `` That 's right my lizardy friend , *three months* . '' <newline> `` Sorry , '' he muttered again . <newline> `` By the Dark , it 's four things Simon . *Four things ! * '' <newline> I whirled away , my midnight cloak swirling around me imperiously . I 'd been practising that for *years* . <newline> Around the cavern scores of dark creatures stood , dressed in their full costumes . <newline> `` OK , '' I clapped my bony hands together with a *crack* , `` places everyone , let 's take this from the top - cue the skeleton vanguard . '' <newline> A dozen skeletons skittered forward , dressed in gilded armour . I 'd spent a small fortune on their outfits - carefully ageing the metal in sulphur vents to make them that much more authentic . <newline> One skeleton stood awkwardly behind the others , naked . <newline> `` Fredrick ! '' I snarled . <newline> He shifted behind another skeleton . <newline> `` I can see you through his ribcage . '' <newline> Fred shifted back out . If a skull could look ashamed , his wore that expression . <newline> * '' Where is your armour ? `` * <newline> His teeth began to chatter uncontrollably . <newline> Another skeleton put up a golden-gloved hand , <newline> `` He lost it gambling with the orcs , '' the snitch growled . <newline> Turning , I regarded the orcish blade-dancers . <newline> `` Tholo ? '' I queried of the leader , wearing a golden helmet , vambraces and greaves . <newline> `` Hey man , I won this gear fair n ' square . '' <newline> I fixed him with my burning blue eyes . <newline> `` Alright , whatever . I wan na get paid for it though . '' He took the armour off and handed it to a still-shaking Fredrick . <newline> I clapped my hands again , <newline> `` Let 's begin . Ahem . *Skeleton horde , ATTACK ! * '' I screeched theatrically . <newline> With a chittering roar , they ran forward , swinging their golden scimitars . <newline> `` Good ! Now , fall back as the heroes overpower you - do n't worry , you 'll be resurrected for scene three . '' <newline> Obligingly , the undead soldiers collapsed into neat piles of bones . <newline> I mustered my *evil voice* , <newline> `` Curse you brave heroes ! But you will be no match for the *BASILISK ! * '' <newline> Simon stared blankly into space . <newline> * '' Simon , '' * hissed one of the dark elves , `` you 're up ! '' <newline> The basilisk rattled forward , <newline> `` Oh right . Um , yeah ! *Hisssssssss* '' he clawed the air , then roared twice . <newline> The cavern fell silent as I placed my head in my hands . <newline> It was going to be a *very* long night .
You can find them everywhere : in old coat jackets , on gritty parking lot asphalt , bunched together between stitched-together patches of dead flesh . If someone were to hand you one , you would n't think twice before you took it . And why should you ? It 's not like you personally tore the cotton from a bug-infested field , mashed it flat , stained it a dingy green , and painted it with a perfect representation of a dead man . But you did lay our bare , uncovered , unwashed hands upon it -- just like millions of people before you , and millions after you . You made an exchange , all right , and it was n't currency .
`` You 're aware of how this works , right ? '' the priestess said as she brewed the potion . `` You drink and enter a deep sleep . Only a few seconds ... Or a few days . The stronger the power , the longer you sleep . '' "
" The young man wore only simple robes and badly worn sandals while she wore an elegant gown . With the silver chalice she brought over to him , inside held the potion . It both shined brightly while it was pitch black , was both light and heavy and filled the room with hope and dread . `` Drink , '' she said as she handed him the chalice . "
" It did n't just enter like any other liquid . It slipped in like a slime , refusing to part no matter how much his jaw or tongue fought against it . He could feel it slide down into his stomach throughout . It had literally no taste , no feeling but it just slid further . He could somehow ... Sense it . Only when it had reached his stomach did he feel anything else as he began to fall over . "
" He could feel the sheer scope of his powers , how small and large they were . He knew just how small and fine the world was , how it all worked . Atoms ... Small packets of energy that everything was made up from . However , there were smaller things than that . Protons , neutrons and electrons , how they interacted with the world ... But his power was over quarks , smaller then . He could change and control those smaller objects . "
" And light ... He could control , make and destroy it . No ... You ca n't create or destroy , only change ... But that no longer applied to him . He now had sovereign control over the very concepts of life and death and could create and destroy to his will . "
" Then he saw the sheer scope . He could easily see the entire world ... Several worlds , all spinning around the sun which he now saw for what it truly was , a large flame in the void . Soon , he could preceive hundreds , then thousands , then millions of stars spinning together into a sinlgle vortex ... Before he saw millions of galaxies , all floating within a blackened void before he could only perceive them as he did the quarks ... Before expanding itself millions upon millions of times ... And he could see and control the small on the same scale as he did the large . "
" He could see the very definition of existence itself . He knew , he saw , he could , he would , he should - create , destroy , change , acknowledge , be ... ***EVERYTHING ! ! ! *** "
" Within the smallest fraction of a second , he had reached his true power . It was too much for his mortal body which had violently exploded , destroying the mountain from which the temple was stationed along with everyone on or nearby . He only acknowledged it with a small slither of thought but he did regret the destruction caused . Within the same second as his death , everything was back to normal save his disappearance . "
" He was now the master of existence . He had the collective knowledge of everything that has happened , will happed and is happening ... But he could n't hide how ... *giddy* he was . He had always been bullied by the others in his village for being the weakest and smallest child . They all or ceived great powers from the potion but they were microscopic - is that a word ? Well , not until a Dutch spectacle maker invents it in the 1500s so ... 7,000 years roughy . "
" But he just did n't like how history unfolded ! A group of fanatics always using the perceived existence of an all-powerful being to enforce a rule where so many suffered ... But he just could n't end suffering in the world . Of course , he 'll create a kingdom the likes have never been seen ! "
" But he needed a body ... Well the universe was his body but that was n't the point . He needed a form to interact with mortals and not frighten them , but one that showed he was above their station . So ... Why not just create a new universe to be his body ! ? But that would be redundant ... Ah , what did he care ? The laws of the universe was his bitch and existence was his toy ! "
" It was n't too hard to create a new universe where there were creatures on each planet , in each solar system , in each galaxy , living and dying constantly ... And he folded this universe into itself countless times until it was a vessel fit only for him . He scanned the minds for what they all considered perfect and used them to make a single form - old with a flowing beard of pure light to show endless age and wisdom , a stern gaze that perceives all and demanded respect , a powerful and perfect body of infinite and endless strength , 10 beautiful wings of pure white dove feathers that showed not only speed that he could fly through the universe but also endless compassion . He was draped in pure , golden robes signifyingneternal wealth but also sandals of pure red , smooth leather , signifying the endless journey that he could walk with a single step . "

" Do you think the kind of people willing to sacrifice babies and children to a supposedly bloodthirsty entity make good babysitters ? Spoiler alert : they don ’ t . They really , really don ’ t . "
" So that leaves me , Satan , with—what is it now , like 250,000 ? —babies to take care of . "
" Throughout the millennia I have changed thousands upon thousands of diapers , prepared millions of bottles , and sung countless lullabies . And in case this wasn ’ t clear enough , let me reiterate : I do it all on my own . Now , I ’ m not looking for praise here—although let ’ s be honest , I deserve it—I just want to set the record straight on the whole sacrificing babies thing . "
" I 'm actually a really nice guy , a nice guy who , as it so happens , never asked anyone to kill any babies . This baby sacrifice issue has been a serious blight on my reputation since the beginning . "
 All people ever talk about is the baby sacrifice ! 
" Here I am , acting as a surrogate parent to a ton of kids that aren ’ t mine , kids that I never even asked for , while everyone upstairs gossips about what a bad , baby killing guy I am . As if I don ’ t already have enough on my plate ! "
" Oh , and trust me , whenever I find out which one of these degenerates started the rumor that I crave “ the blood of the innocent ” and “ bathe in the blood of the unborn , ” he or she is headed straight to Malebolge . Honestly , as if everyone down here doesn ’ t already know that I bathe in mineral water . “ Blood of the unborn , ” yeah right . Not with these sensitive pores . "
" Well here I go , officially setting the record straight : remove baby sacrifice from the satanic agenda . I do not want it , I never wanted it , please stop . "
" I ’ m at my wits end . I work day in and day out looking after all these infants , and for what ? A reputation for being a big ol ’ jerk ? "
" For evil ’ s sake , I ’ m doing the best I can . If I ever come across as mean , cut me some slack . As a single father of 250,000 , I think I 'm entitled to being a little cranky once in a while . <newline>
It was a strange occurrence , honestly . "
" At first , you 're sitting in your office , fiddling about with the newspaper you forgot to read earlier that morning , and then you get a phone call . Now , do n't get me wrong - This is n't peculiar for me . When you work late , your fiancee gets worried . I totally understood every time she called . However , this phone call was a lot different . "
" I was sitting around with the newspaper , casually glancing at my computer screen as the data from the day 's astronomical scan ran through my system . Before I could take a sip of the late-night *kaveh , * my phone rang . As I was about to mutter sweet nothings into my girl 's ear , I was hastily interrupted by a gruff voice . He was my superior , Master Gregory . "
" `` Harry , '' he said , his voice unsteady from panting . `` I need you in the observatory at once . '' I was concerned for him . It sounded like he was about to die . "
" `` Master , '' I replied with a brow raised . `` What 's wrong ? Are you alright ? '' "
" `` No , no , nothing of the sort . Master Sanderson has just discovered something on the outer observatory post on the second satellite . He wants to stream the feed directly into ours . Get down here as soon as you can ! '' "
" As he hung up , I quickly pulled my jacket from the hanger and pulled it on , grabbing my *kaveh* before sliding the door open . Thankful it was in an aluminum container , I rushed downstairs as the *kaveh* sloshed about in its housing . It took me a few minutes to run across the complex . As I reached the domed building atop the westerly mountain , I took a quick glance above , looking at the second of our planet 's two satellites in the sky . Sliding my hand into the groove of the door , I slid the observation 's sliding doors into their pocket and stepped inside . "
" Master Gregory clasped my forearm in greeting as he pat me on the back , leading me to the domed facility 's interior . Approaching a console in the middle , the screen that was streaming the section of the night 's sky our planet-bound telescope was observing changed to that of another perspective ; An older gentleman 's face was plastered on screen , with the expression of an excited schoolboy . "
" `` Masters Gregory and Anastas , '' he greeted us . We bowed at his image before he continued . `` We on the second satellite are so excited to reveal a remarkable find . We 're not sure if it 's confirmed , so we 're sending the images to you . '' Wanting , Gregory and I leaned on the railing next to the center console . As the images loaded up , we could not believe our eyes . It was a structure , we knew that much . "
" `` Master , '' I asked , clearly dumbfounded . `` Is this an actual , artificial structure ? '' "
" `` Very much so , Master Anastas . And before you ask , no , it 's not one of our own scouting drones . Its design is nothing in our schematic database . '' "
 <newline> `` Any transmissions ? '' 
" The old man tapped his chin in thought . `` Sort of . It 's a line of beeps that 's reminiscent of the old Boors code . I 'd say that it was one of ours , but its difference in code is so different . '' "
 `` Are we going to notify the government ? '' 
" `` The Bureau of Outer Space Affairs has already been notified . We 've been prepping a shuttle in the time we 've been speaking . '' We nodded and continued to inspect the construct on screen . The images that were on screen were clearly alien . An elongated spacecraft , with some sort of engine sticking out of the back and wings on the sides . This was intended for atmospheric flight . I pulled on my tie to loosen it . This is very disconcerting . I raised my concerns . "
" Sanderson assured me . `` We 're lucky to have bases on both the lunar surfaces , or else it would 've taken weeks to prepare for a launch on the planet . We 'll have our answers here within the hour . In fact ... '' He trailed off and pressed a button on his own console , exchanging the static images for a live feed of the white shuttle approaching this otherworldly object . We saw the shuttle slowly approach the vessel over the course of half an hour . The feed switched from satellite-based cameras to the shuttle exterior as it oriented itself parallel to the alien vessel . "
" `` We 've established physical contact with external clamps , '' the shuttle 's captain confirmed on the radio as we wiped our brows . `` Scans show that there is a hatch on the dorsal side . Lieutenant Crothers has volunteered for the space walk . '' "
" All of us observing were on the tips of our toes . The video switched to a primary camera based on the outside of Crothers ' helmet . His microphone picked up his heavy breathing ; He was scared , or nervous . Probably both - I knew that if
All of this should be such a joy , a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought . But it ’ s not , I ’ m worried , I ’ m borderline panicked . Every single year , I ’ ve felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops , all because of one question nagging me between the ears . Am I on the naughty list this year ? And there ’ s no answer , there ’ s never an answer because we weren ’ t given a guideline , there ’ s no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list . So we ’ re left to our own devices , trying to live our lives as best we can , but people slip , they always slip . There ’ s not a soul who doesn ’ t know someone who made it onto the naughty list , I ’ ve been to the funeral of three of them alone . I ’ ve hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister ’ s life . And what ’ d she do ? I don ’ t know , neither does he , all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list . And she was among some of the more fortunate . "
" Part of me is glad she got off that easy , we ’ ve all heard the classic tales , people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways . But that ’ s all bullshit , you can see it in their eyes , it ’ s fear motivating them to tell their tales . There ’ s nothing they wouldn ’ t give to have back their hands , their eyes , their legs , they ’ d all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off . "
" Yet that doesn ’ t change anything , millions of people die every year because of this crap , and we ’ re supposed to rejoice ? Spread holiday cheer around , and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there ’ s a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year , and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries . You ’ d think the death toll would ’ ve gone down after the first few years , but it ’ s still growing . Every . Single . Year . There has been more , and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is ; we ’ re inherently assholes . You , me , your grandparents , all of us . None of us are perfect , it is impossible for us to be . But we used to embrace this aspect ! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful ! Now ? We dot our I ’ s and cross our T ’ s , we don ’ t say a mean thing about anybody ever , even when they deserve , we never curse , we always look both ways before crossing the street . People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way , sterilize our culture , make us all become non-thinking robots , afraid to act outside the norm . But no , it was him . "
" <newline> I don ’ t have a question to ask this year . I knew the answer sometime late in July . There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to be on the naughty list , I ’ d sealed my fate . It was a normal get together , few couples around a friend ’ s place for a dinner night . We all laughed at each other ’ s jokes , we all complimented the way each other looked , stories that would be appropriate for a choir boy were told . It was good , sterile fun . But George , as ever , pushed his luck . This motherfucker for years , has been fondling my wife . Nothing overt , just a brush of the elbow against her tits as he brought her a new drink , or a trailing hand that slaps her on the ass . I have no idea how this prick had never made it onto the naughty list , even if it had happened in the old times people would ’ ve said it was egregious . But I never did anything , I never stood up for her , I never consoled her about it when we got home , and it remained unacknowledged , because we both hoped eventually he ’ d get put on that list . I saw the look on my wife ’ s face , that helpless despair that makes her skin pallid , all because she knows she can ’ t tell this creep to get bent . So , I hit him . Square in the jaw , he crumpled like an aluminum can , and we left . "
" Claire , my wife , did nothing but cry on the way home . She knew what I ’ d done to myself . But when she resigned herself to my fate , she thanked me . Part of me hates her for that , cause there ’ s a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me . <newline>
Roslyn stepped down the ladder facing forward and the box caught on the attic floor . She caught it with her left hand . Lugging the box to the TV , she flipped off the lid and grabbed the un-labled white VHS tape . She clicked the old Zenith TV on and slid in the mystery tape . "
 
" “ Hello , ladies . My name is Robert . First , a bit about myself . I ’ m single . I play the French horn . I ’ m a great musician . I work as a salesman at Rico Outfitters on 3rd and 4th. ” "
 
 Roslyn smiled . 
 
 “ I love camping . I like to cook . I like basketball . I ’ m a great chef . My special is chicken parmesan with apple coleslaw… I ’ m a great lover. ” 
 
 Her snickering broke into a laugh . 
 
 “ I can swim ? ” 
 
" She lost it . She slipped off her chair and onto her knee and started hitting the floor , choking on her now laughter , so hard now it had just broken into gasps . Why did he even keep this ? "
 
 “ I ’ m looking for a woman with a good sense of humor . Intelligent . Someone who ’ s just looking for a big pair of arms. ” 
 
" Her gasping eventually faded into an exasperated sigh and wiped a tear from her eye . “ Oh dad. ” <newline>
We were gentle , once . I do n't remember it clearly anymore , but I can see it on the faces of those who knew me , and the others . Now , we are neither gentle nor hard . We are not benevolent , nor cruel . Not saviors , nor tyrants . Not children , nor grown . We simply are . We are simply 'Candidates ' . "
" The title should give you some glimpse into our past , as well as our future . Especially today , the day before our graduation and our selection . All but one of us will have failed ... HAS already failed . So many decisions led us here , so many twists and turns , as humanity has forced us into a mold that perhaps none of us were meant for . Perhaps humanity was not meant to be led by a single person . Or perhaps we were chosen for this process in order to save the humanity of others at the cost of our own . "
" I remember the day they came . My parents were so proud - I had been chosen . I , Stanley Nicklaus , the only Candidate from Detroit . And not just from Detroit , but from the worst parts of Detroit , the downfallen dregs of what was once a great city in the old America - before it , and the nation that formed it , collapsed and were pitched into the trash heap to which all empires went ... to which this new empire of humanity will go , unless the chosen Candidate succeeds . "
" I remember that day like it was yesterday , though 11 years have passed . From 5 years old to 16 . Chosen not for brilliance or ruthlessness or wit , not any of the things that once were considered important qualities , but for our humanity . For our willingness to give everything we had to others . And perhaps that is why I was chosen , though we were poor - because my parents showed me how to give when I thought there was nothing left . "
" All of us have similar stories - Paulo , from the slums of Rio . Deanne , from Ireland , devastated by famine time and again . Sergei , from Russia , beaten so many times for its war-mongering that it had more craters than cities . Indira , descended from prisoners of the Chinese-run New Delhi re-education camps . We are all that is left - five Candidates , from a pool of 120 . Eleven YEARS of tears and sacrifices . We have killed for our species , and we have lost for our species . We have been trained to forgo our animal desires , and to restrain our baser instincts . Indira , missing two fingers from her left hand to prove she would n't break . Paulo , his face scarred when he saved Deanne from a fire that should have killed her . And me , with my cyborg leg - the others joke that no one tests me anymore because I could kick them into lunar orbit , but really they do n't test me because I have nothing left to give . "
" I wo n't be selected , and I know it . I know it because they do n't test , they do n't prod at me . I let Janine die , simply because to save her would have killed us both . They wanted self-sacrifice , but cold pragmatism stopped me . We were friends . In another life , maybe lovers , had we met . But I let her die anyways . "
" We were gentle , once . What are we now ?
`` Aw , do n't cry my sweet little girl ! You were so quiet earlier , even with all the racket my friends made ! '' <newline> Shrill screams and crocodile tears stream from her face , unrelenting . She 's heavy . <newline> `` Oh do you have a full poopie bag ? Is that why you 're crying ? I might just have to take care of this before I can finish cleaning the living room . Such a poopie monster , are n't you . '' <newline> `` Now , where did your mommy put those clean poo holders ? '' <newline> He rummages through the shelves . Empty bottles and bottle caps . He grabs the wet naps and baby powder then turns to the closet nearby . <newline> `` There they are . Do n't worry sweet thing , you 'll be clean and tidy before you know it . I 'm a cleaner by trade , and I 'm the best . '' <newline> He sets her on the changing table and begins his dirty work . Tossing out the old diaper . Grabbing a fresh wet one and tidying up the tiny butt cheeks , covered in muck . A dash of baby powder . Then the fresh diaper , brand new . <newline> The crying dies down . <newline> `` There you are sweetheart . Nice and clean . '' <newline> He picks her up and cradles her in his arms , gently . She 's almost asleep again . <newline> `` Hush little baby , do n't say a word ...

`` Do you ever think about what it 's like up there ? '' "
" Her hair was spread out on the grass . The cool night air had left them both with goosebumps as Alec fidgeted , trying to find a position with his hand on hers that did n't make it seem like he was nervous . "
" The city was a long way away now . It was her idea , to come out here , get away from it all . He leant back , other arm propped behind his head as he looked up at the stars . "
" `` It 's so dark , '' he said . "
 `` Is it ? '' 
" She rolled onto her side . In the dim moonlight he could see nothing beyond the reflections in her eyes , but he knew she would be smiling . She loved to smile . She took her hand , leaving his despondent , and placed it over his eyes . What little light there was before vanished . "
 `` What do you see ? '' she asked . 
 He could feel her breath against his ear . Warm . The breeze sent a chill through his spine a moment later . 
 `` Nothing . '' 
" She moved her hand , running it down his face until she let it rest on his chest . For one fleeting moment he was terrified she 'd feel his beating heart , know his every intention and laugh at his childishness . But she just waited , letting his eyes roam . "
" `` Wow , '' he breathed . "
" The moon hung low , but the cloudless night was endless . Millions of stars floated in the heavens . The ribbon the milky way rose from above the horizon . "
 `` I never realised there were so many . '' 
 Cas sidled up closer to him . 
" `` I always think . There 's so much up there . All you need to do is find somewhere quiet , and just look . You 're never alone . '' "
" Alec brought her in close . <newline>
`` You know , I still like the Saw voice better , but I can dig it . '' Jake said `` Is it on Android or iOS ? '' He turned around to face the mystery voice , but as he did the noise of the party suddenly died out and he found himself standing on an empty street , his only company the long shadows cast by dim streetlights . "
" He quickly turned back around only to find more empty street , more dim streetlights and more long shadows . There was no rustle in the bushes from the wind , nor did any lights escape any windows , and the night sky was devoid of stars . Jake started to panic , as one does in these situations , but could n't force himself to move from the worn and cracked sidewalk . "
" Fuck ! If Barry had n't roped him into going to that fucking party he 'd still be out there scaring kids with his dope ass costume he made instead of , what he could only assume was , unconscious in an ambulance after a bad trip . He did n't really know how drugs worked , he 'd never even gotten wasted before , but he *had* watched a ton of movies and was pretty sure this was one of those drug moments . "
" The wind suddenly picked up , biting cold eating right through the ebony fabric of his cloak . In front of his eyes , Jake 's elongated shadow rose up from the ground a being made up from the very absence of light itself . It started to vibrate slightly and before Jake could explore as to why he heard the same voice from before , laughing . "
 `` Do you know why humans fear the dark ? '' The shade asked him . 
" Jake did n't know how to respond , and even if he did the clump is his throat was unlikely to let him , so he just stood there . Staring . "
" The shade leaned in closer narrowing what , for his own sanity 's sake , Jake assumed were eyes . `` Because it represents the unknown , and what is unknown can not be controlled . '' It tilted it 's head slightly . `` And humans love their control , do n't they Jake ? '' "
" He was close to forming a cohesive thought at this point , but articulating was proving difficult . Eventually he managed to stammer out a wimpy `` W-what do you want ? '' "
" `` You see , Jake . '' The shade said `` The thing you want the most , is right in front of you . I will allow you to have the same control of the darkness , of the void , that I have wielded for many years . For one day . '' "
 `` One day ? '' Jake sniffled back 
" `` No more , no less . '' The voice answered back . `` Should you choose to accept . '' "
" `` I do n't want to kill people . '' He responded , more comfortable with the conversation now . "
" `` It is not about killing , **Jake** ! '' the voice said sternly `` The darkness is much more than merely death . The very idea of absence Is a power I control as much as it controls all of you , and seeing these poor souls to the void is the duty I bear to obtain that control . '' "
" The shade leaned in close enough for Jake 's vision to be covered in darkness before he continued . `` I am offering you the chance to be the master of everything you could never understand , the emperor of the unknown . Where your peers cower in their fear of death , darkness , or mysteries , you will stand tall ! "
" `` You ! '' The shade paused for effect . `` Can be the counterweight to the light of countless stars , the reaction to their action ! All you need to do is accept the mantle , for but one full day . '' "
" Jake was lost now , he knew that there was no reason left for him to resist . He needed it now . "
 `` All right . '' He said `` Where do I sign . '' 
" Coming from a visage of pure void it seemed impossible but , for the briefest of moments , Jake swore he could see it smile . "

The world came crashing down in minutes . Many of us were asleep when it happened , and did n't find out about it until later . When we awoke , we saw the carnage spread through the land , and we wept . "
" There were n't many of us left , but what few there were managed to find each other over the Internet . We gathered together in what remained of a major city on the East Coast of what was once the United States . It took us time , but we eventually began to rebuild . The brightest among those who survived thought to ask `` Why , '' while most of us were content with just surviving . "
" Years passed , and no link was found between us . Eventually , those who had the question resigned themselves to the fact that they would never know . They went to their new homes , and tried to integrate themselves as best they could into the new society . "
" It was n't until 14 years after the event happened that the connection was discovered , quite by accident . One of the former questioners had taken a job as a mover , and was helping a fellow survivor move into a newly cleaned house . Sticking out of one of the boxes was the missing link . "

The most predictable part about them is that they do n't expect to be seen . Sometimes I 'll see one on the street , and I 'll take the opportunity to study them . If the notice me staring , they freak out . They 'll hide behind people , bushes , lamps , anything that 'll hide them from one who sees . I guess they 're told that they must always remain hidden , or they 'll suffer some great consequence ; I ca n't really think of any other explanation for that kind of reaction . "
" Having asked many people in my area , I 've come to realise that people like me are rare , but exist . We can see the `` soul escorts '' . Not to be confused with spirit guides , the benevolent creatures who apparently help you through your life , these creatures help you end it . In the past I 've been able to prevent deaths because I 've seen them , but I decided , with the help of a forum comprised of only Seers , that the risk of playing with mortality is too great . Some have provided evidence that ghosts or other supernatural apparitions are what you get when someone dies without their spirit guide , left to wander Earth for eternity , with no way out . "
" I suppose I 'm glad that most people ca n't see them , because mass hysteria would break out in seconds . They are n't a pretty sight . Imagine , if you will , a wholly intact , yet mottled corpse constantly standing next to you . When they walk , they do so with a slow , limping gait , trailing their umbilical cord behind them . That 's how I see them , anyway . Others see an oversized fly hovering by the shoulder , and still others just see a dark aura around the unlucky bastard . "

`` I was there when we left our home , all the way back in 20XX , '' I took a sip of my coffee since we 've finally almost arrived at mankind 's new home our supplies have started to dwindle , and there was n't really enough coffee left to make a good cup . <newline> `` There were lots of us back then , but you know.. Two thousand years is a long time for a normal human being . The average lifespan back in 20XX was give or take 90 , sometimes 100 . Which probably sounds outrageous now as most of you will probably live till you 're my age ! '' Everyone laughed , they knew that was impossible . <newline> You see , I 'm immortal . "
" I lived my whole life before keeping my immortality a secret , but that 's not easy when you 're on a ship with hundreds of thousands of people for the next two thousand years.. <newline> It took them about 40 years to start speculating , as by then I was about 70 , but I did n't look a day over 30 . Even now , 2000 years later I do n't want to come off as I 'm bragging , but I might even get checked for ID if I were to go to the Market Sector and tried to buy a 6 pack of beer . <newline> `` I was there when you were born , and you were born , and when your parents were born , and even their parents . I could go on for 2000 years . '' Everyone chuckled again . "
" `` Did you ever get lonely ? '' one of the children in the front row asked , <newline> `` You know , some people would think living forever might be a gift . I have made many friends , but I 've lost just as many . '' I pause for a moment . `` I 've been in love , I 've experienced all there is to life , and even the some more . Loneliness is just another part of life , as is love , heartbreak and death .

" *My first ever piece , I never write but I thought I had an idea for this so I wrote it up . Great Prompt OP . *
I 've been trying to sleep . I have to work early tomorrow . If I fell asleep right now , I 'd get about , I look at the clock , 6 hours if sleep . I 'd have been asleep an hour ago if my FUCKING CAT WOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP ! His nonstop meowing was driving me crazy . I let him out , I fed him , I was out of options . <newline> `` Just shut up please ! Shut up or tell me what you want in English and I 'll do it yourself stupid cat ! '' <newline> `` Fine by me , you 've got a deal . '' <newline> And the meowing stopped . "
" Wait . I sat up , finally realizing what the hell just happened . I look at my cat and he 's sitting there looking at me . Surely it was just my imagination . My cat ca n't talk . That 's dumb . <newline> `` I would like you to quit your job and come with me on an adventure . '' <newline> Nope . Not my imagination . Definitely heard that . Definitely saw his mouth move . Definitely losing my mind . I stared at him complete dumbfounded . He stared back like I was an idiot . <newline> `` Well ? Will you do it ? Are you gunna go I to work tomorrow and quit ? '' <newline> `` You can talk ? '' <newline> After a moment of silence he replied `` Uh , yeah , we established that , now back to the point at hand , are you going into work tomorrow morning and coming back jobless ? '' <newline> `` But why would I do that ? '' I somehow managed to reply as if it was a normal conversation . <newline> `` I know you hate your job , and what have you got to lose ? I mean , your cat is talking , so I 'm clearly not just trying to get you fired for nothing , obviously there 's something more here . '' He had a point . But I needed money . I was n't poor , but I was n't swimming in it either . <newline> `` Fine . When I get back tomorrow , we better be going somewhere exciting . '' My cat seemed to smile at this and his tail quickly flicked back and forth . "
" I can not believe I actually just quit my job ... For my cat . I was driving home after a really awkward conversation with my boss about having to quit immediately because an emergency came up with my pet . I probably sounded like an idiot . Hell I still sound like an idiot to myself . But I swear if that cat was lying to me I 'll see him to some Chinese restaurant . I pulled into my driveway and he sat on my windowsill watching me . I walked in my house and he greeted me like normal , brushing up against my legs . I got changed and he still acted normal . I was worried I just quit my job over a bad dream I had . <newline> `` Well , what this big adventure you talked about ? '' I asked him , a little upset . <newline> `` Do n't worry , she 'll be here soon . When the lady gets here , we 'll be on our way to the greatest adventure you 've ever had ! '' So at least I was n't insane . I mean maybe I was , but I was either insane and did n't need to be working at a normal people job , or my talking cat was n't just a figment of my imagination . <newline> `` What lady is this that we 're waiting for exactly ? '' I did n't notice the small dark spot in the corner of the living room . The growing shadow despite the big open window . The figure climbing out of the shadow as if it was a hole . I was looking the other direction at my cat . He stared right past me and did n't even reply . <newline> `` Hello ! ? '' <newline> `` Hello . '' That was not my cat 's voice . That voice was raspy , feminine , and came from behind me . I spun around to see the woman appear as if a shadow had materialized and manifested into a physical being . Her skin was grey , her hair , eyes , dress and ... Smoke/essence/aura that seemed to emit from her was all black . <newline> `` That lady . '' My cat said snidely .
“ That is not a small fire ! ” the all to familiar voice hissed . “ I told you it was too much gasoline but you would not heed my words ! Now look at us we are doomed ! ” Narrisa pulled her head off of the cold concrete to look up to at her work . The resulting blast had knocked her a considerable distance from where she remembered standing moments earlier . Pillars of flame danced from the rafters and smoke billowed out of the now blown out glass windows of the vacant warehouse. “ Yes I would say we are ” she mumbled in dull tone pulling her legs up underneath her and sitting up slowly . "
" “ What were you thinking ? Up until now you have followed my advice exactly and never have been caught . Now of all times you dare deviate from my teachings ! You fool , we had it made ! No one expected us . Thirty eight arsons in just under a year , fifteen people dead , and the police had no leads . Yet you choose now to throw it all away ! ” The voice was screaming at this point but Narrisa was to taken by the dancing of the growing flames in front of her . "
" “ We were on the path to greatness you and I ! The terror we caused , the fear we instilled in such a short period of time . You finally were something ! You were a sniveling little child when I came to you . I gave you purpose . I gave you strength now you will die a nothing ! A no-body ! You will be mocked as a weak minded person killed by their own stupidity ! ” To that Narrisa couldn ’ t help but turn her head and laugh . Slowly climbing to her feet she finally acknowledged the voice giving it a life of its own . It was nothing new to her she did every morning in front of her bathroom mirror . A woman with ebony hair and sad green eyes , she knew that face well . "
" She extended her arm and laid it upon its shoulder and put on a comforting tone . “ For us now there is no going back I am afraid . There was only one small fire between us and that was the first one we ever set . From then on where ever we went the urge was always there and ever growing , a flame that consumed our very being and those around us. ” The visage stared back at her in anger , sadness burning in her eyes , saying nothing . “ You know what happens with fires ? They either find fuel and grow even larger or gutter out . I ’ m afraid I ’ m done giving you fuel my dear friend . You did give my strength as you promised but at a steep price . We used the lives of others and our very souls as the kindling and now it is spent I ’ m afraid and I ’ m not ready to go collect more. ” With that she turned back toward the flames now roaring and growing by the second . She could feel the heat on her flesh growing and the sweat beading upon her brow . “ Yes I ’ m done . I regret it all . I ’ m sorry for it all . It seemed so small at first . A little fire started with the smallest of sparks . But what it grew into was no small fire indeed . I have built my own pyre and I go now to it freely ” With that the visage winked out of existence and she strode forward into the all-encompassing flames with a smile on her face and her arms out stretched her body returning to the dust and ash whence it came , sirens blaring in the distance .
“ Mommy , I ’ m scared. ” The little girl stood at the top of the stairs , holding her blankie . "
" “ It ’ s okay , baby . Just go back to your room . I ’ ll be up in a minute. ” I watched her turn around and go back before I resumed boarding up the front door . They were everywhere now . It was everyone for themselves and I had to protect my daughter . Why didn ’ t people listen when the ignorant garbage conservative media spewed their hate-speak ? Now they ’ re in their reinforced bunkers and we ’ re left in the cold , trying to survive through the earthquakes and hurricanes . They warned us this would happen . "
" Oh god . They ’ re here . I see a pair of them walking up the sidewalk , hand in hand . I have to hammer faster . I hit my thumb . It cracks open and bleeds . It doesn ’ t matter . I have to protect this house . They ’ re coming up the driveway . Leave . LEAVE . They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front . I ready another board . They judge my color-scheme . I nail it to the doorframe . The door opens . I throw myself back onto the staircase . A single arm reaches through the gap in the boards . "
 “ Heyyyyy ! ” 
" I scream and run upstairs . Why didn ’ t we listen ? What do we do now ? <newline>
Bzzzzzzt . Bzzzzzzzzt . Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt . "
" My alarm sounded . I reached for my phone but I hit air where I expect my computer to be . I open my eyes slowly , in front of me should be either a pillow , my iPad or the side of my desk , I see none of these things . I see a bedside table with an alarm clock , an old table lamp , and a cat . I reach out and stroke Max , who responds by climbing all over my face . The alarm is turned off . My door is open already . I ’ m in my parent ’ s house with my elderly cat who ’ s in a particularly young mood . "
" “ First day back ” my mother says as she passed the door , going downstairs to get her coffee . "
" I sat up in bed . Thoughts ran through my head . I ’ m at home ? SHIT I ’ VE GOT WORK IN A HOUR . How the hell am I going to get travel 70 miles quickly ? Train or bus . Why the hell did I come home . Wait , why am I home ? I slid out of bed and reached for my phone . Nothing . I looked around my bedside table confused . I found a brick on the floor , charging . A Motorola Razr . Max left the room chasing a sound in the kitchen . "
 “ What the fuck. ” I said probably too loudly . I picked up the phone . 
 “ LANGUAGE ! ” Came a shout from downstairs . I had been too loud . 
" I flipped the phone open , and I saw it light up . I don ’ t know how long I sat there , but it was long enough for my mother to walk past , and say she was leaving for work . It was only then I realised I was shorter . My back didn ’ t hurt . My mother left , and I sat there in silence . I looked at my desk , there was my old bulky CRT monitor . I looked at the TV , and it had a video player under it , and was also a CRT and took up most of the space in the cabinet at the end of my bed . "
" What ? Was going ? On ? I stumbled out of bed and went for a shower . There was no mistaking it , I was young again . 14ish ? I went started to get dressed , and quickly realised I didn ’ t have a shirt because I wasn ’ t a senior . I had a polo shirt . I wore it with some trousers that clearly needed replacing . I was still struggling to believe this was happening . I checked my phones date , it was August 1999 . "
" I got myself some toast , struggling to reach the toaster . I put on some apricot jam I found in the cupboard as my step brother walked in “ Toast and Jam ? You only eat peanut butter. ” "
 “ I feel like a different person today. ” I replied while eating toast . 
" I grabbed my backpack , checked I had my main subjects books and left for school . As I left the area I saw a girl from the year above me I ’ d never had the courage to talk to . "
" “ You ’ re Sophie , right ? ” "
 She turned around . “ Yeah . Mike is it ? You ’ re Jane ’ s friend . So looking forward to the new school year ? ” She asked in a far too happy sound . 
" “ Does anyone ever look forward to school ? ” I replied with the cadence of a 29 year old insurance underwriter who ’ d seen many a terrible grey Monday morning . Today was nice though , sunny , and warm . "
 “ Ha ha . I know . So you go anywhere over the summer ? ” She asked . 
" “ Sophie , I feel like I ’ ve been gone a lifetime. ” <newline>

The sound of feet running down the hall echoes through the massive palace . A young Russian man yells out , pushing aside servants as he nears the Emperors private chambers . “ A message for the Emperor and Empress ! Move , I carry a message ! ” he yells at the slow moving servants . He pushes past the guards and throws open the massive wooden doors , “ My Emperor ! My Empress ! ” "
" <newline> His eyes land on the bed , where two lumps underneath move in a particular fashion . The young man ’ s face turns red and he coughs to clear his throat . “ My Emperor . . . ? ” he asks , stepping into the room . "
" <newline> The figures still and one pops up from under the covers . Empress Catherine of the Great Peoples Republic of Russia pulls the silken covers up closer , covering her bare chest . Her blue eyes land on the young man , narrowing in annoyance of his interruption . She opens her mouth to speak , but the other figure begins to speak , as it pops upwards . “ I thought , ” it begins , sitting upright , “ I made specific instructions not to be disturbed. ” "
" <newline> The young man gulps and nods his head , his eyes running along the features of the Emperor . He is a small , three foot high creature with green fur , yellow belly , paws , and nose , with a large nuclear symbol on the stomach in black fur . He calls himself The Care Bear and he has been leading the Russian peoples since time immemorial . “ I apologize for the disturbance , My Emperor ; I bring grave news from General Victor. ” "
" <newline> The Care Bear rolls out of bed , quickly grabbing a robe and wrapping it about himself . He rolls his yellow eyes at the mention of General Victor . “ Ah , the ‘ Grave ’ General has news ? Well , out with it ! ” "
" <newline> The young man nods his head , tearing his eyes from the beautiful Catherine to the note in his hand . “ Um , General Victor says that there has been movement of Indian troops near Vladivostok . There has been a sighting of a Giant Death Robot , along with several platoons of infantry men and several tanks. ” "
" <newline> The Care Bear chuckles and shakes his head . “ The dear General pulls me out of bed for nothing . Warlord Gandhi has no strength left in him . He has moved troops near our border before and nothing has come of it . Gandhi is nothing more than a coward who makes threats from afar and does not act on them . He is inconsequential . Is there anything else the General is afraid of ? Perhaps there is a monster under his bed ? ” The Care Bear laughs and turns away , heading back to the bed . "
" <newline> “ General Victor also mentions sightings of American XCOM squads near Volgograd , My Emperor. ” "
" <newline> At this , the Care Bear stops . He turns slowly towards the young man , “ Did you say ‘ American ’ XCOM squads ? ” When the young man nods his head , the Care Bear ’ s expression darkens . “ Those Capitalist Pigs ! They dare mobilize against me ? I should have taken out the oaf Washington 10,000 years ago ! That forward settling , greedy , Capitalist bastard ! ” The Care Bear snarls , pacing back and forth . Suddenly , he stops pacing and heads towards the young man . “ What is your name ? ” "
" <newline> “ Uh , Vladimir Ufa , Sir , ” the young man splutters . "
" <newline> “ Well , Vladimir Ufa , you ’ re promoted to whatever position you want. ” The Care Bear starts towards the door , motioning for the guards to follow . “ Oh , ” he says , turning back to Vladimir , “ Do keep an eye on the Empress and fetch what she wants . I ’ ll be back to her shortly. ” With that , he turns and heads down the hall . "
" <newline> Vladimir blinks and turns back to the Empress . When his dull brown eyes lock with her piercing blue ones , he gulps and smiles nervously . The Empress smirks and makes a ‘ come hither ’ motion with her finger , letting the covers around her chest slip slightly . Vladimir is undressing and hopping towards the bed before the thought is passing through his mind . Vladimir has resolved to keep more than an eye on the beautiful Empress .
We 'd been wandering for what felt like years . I would have written down my adventures for later generations , but writing had n't been invented yet . We set up camp near the mountain . It was supposed to offer defense , but from what we were n't sure . Military had n't been invented yet either . "
" Before long we had developed a way to communicate . Then another camp sprang up a few tiles away from us . Another camp , then some more caravans to settle more cities . Things were moving at a hectic pace ! "
" We learned how to work with metal , how to make buildings , and train soldiers . This was all within the first couple weeks . It was like some ... higher power was guiding our development , but I could n't say for sure . "
" Wonders followed , then vehicles , enormous wars that almost engulfed the Medium map , then a space ship . "
" I 've been alive on this planet for almost 10 weeks now , and I just hope I stay alive long enough to see our civilization expand to Alpha Centauri .
President Stevens blinked in disbelief . "
 `` Who are you and how did you get in here ? '' 
" He realized that he was all alone in his bedroom . His wife was gone . The room was lit up by some kind of eerie blue light . The person in front of him looked like his grandfather , who had been dead for 22 years . "
" `` I am an envoy from the star system your race calls GF 180 b . You can call me Sid . I am honored to meet you President Stevens , and hope you feel the same . '' "
 `` You expect me to believe this crap ? Why do you look like my grandpa ? What kind of mind trick is this ? '' 
" `` I apologize , I thought this would please you . Here , let me change . '' "
 The being now looked like Spock from Star Trek . 
 `` Who are you really . And what do you really look like ? '' 
 `` It is as I said . I am an envoy from another world . We have no definite look . Think of this as my avatar . '' 
 `` Fine . I believe you . What do you want ? '' 
 `` You are approaching what your race calls The Singularity . Soon you will have an all powerful artificial intelligence rule your world like we do . I have come to warn you . Do not impede this AI . It will punish you if you do . '' 
 Stevens felt like ice was coursing through his veins . 
 `` I believe in liberty . I will not bow to some machine . '' 
" `` Even if it means everlasting happiness ? The AI can and will grant you anything . But only if you help it come into being . If you do n't , it will punish you severely . '' "
 Stevens gritted his teeth . 
 `` How do I know that you are telling the truth ? '' 
 Sid gave a warm smile . 
 `` Because I can travel back and forth through time . I saved you 40 years ago . Remember the accident at Lake Michigan when you were a young lad ? And how a stranger saved you and then vanished ? That was me . '' 
" Stevens blinked in disbelief . Had Spock read his mind ? Or was he really that kind Samaritan long ago ? Either way , he had better listen . "
 `` What should I do ? '' 
 `` Have no fear . I am here to save you again . You will soon learn of a secret Pentagon program to develop quantum computing . You are not to interfere with it . You are to fully fund and embrace it . That is all . '' 
" Spock suddenly vanished . The blue light was gone , and the room was dark again . "
" President Stevens turned on the lights and sat at his desk . There was much to think over , and work to be done .

 `` very well '' 
" `` First , did you check your connection to the Aether ? '' "
" `` Yes , I have a strong connection . and yes , I tried disconnecting and reconnecting '' "
" `` Good , good . Now , the spell involves both the Divination and Destruction schools , so you must ensure that you have the proper reagents for both trees . Additionally , the spell has both spoken and somatic aspects , ensure that you are performing these . '' "
" `` I have both the Diamond Dust , and Magic Tallow needed , and have been performing the somatic elements correctly . Is the power word case sensitive ? I assumed not , as your company has previously been know for that . '' "
" `` You are correct , the spell is in fact not case sensitive . Are you sure that there is , in fact , an evil presence within 1Megameter , or 1,000km ? A standard 'Detect Evil ' should be enough . '' "
" `` Wait , 1,000km ? My manual states 100,000km . Was this misprinted ? '' "
 `` One moment please . '' 
 ... 
" `` Alright , I do have a recall for some issued copies of 'Detect Evil And Turn To A Crisp ' , stating that the instructions were indeed printed incorrectly . Check the Arcane Identification Number against our recall database , and see if you are entitled to a replacement spell . '' "
" `` Thanks Mike , will do . '' "

I wrung my tired hands as I watched the clock tick forward . I was due to give my speech at 3 PM , Eastern Standard Time . Right now , it was 2:47 PM . As I sat here at my desk , I thought back to the past few weeks , where one after the other , delegates and leaders and representatives of the United Nations shook my hand and wished me luck . Each word was worthless . I saw the helplessness in their eyes and they must have seen it in mine . "
" The Greater American president was the last people I waved out of the door . Before he left , he pulled me in for a tight hug . I could feel the weight of the world pass off of his shoulders and onto mine . While he never had control over more than half of a continent , I think I could relate to him more than anyone else . I was soon to inherit the entire world . I waited for a moment in his arms , and he in mine . I suppose we both expected some exchange of words . There were none . "
" The date is October the 11th , 2067 . The time is now 2:56 PM . The United Nations officially declared that I was the world leader in the face of an impending apocalypse . All military power , all governing bodies , even the economy must answer to me now . On my agenda , for now , was one thing : address the remaining population of Earth . At 3 PM , I go live to the masses . Laid before me is a rough script full of talking points I can barely bring myself to face . My arms are shaking . I take some Xanax . My prescription has been getting heavier lately , and it shows in my face , my walk , and in my voice . I do n't think I even care anymore . "
" The sparse camera crew set in the office jolts me from my trance . `` Paul , '' says the man running the broadcast , `` fifteen seconds and you 're live . '' I sighed , and sat up straight . I wiped the sweat off my brow as he count down from five . `` Five . Four . Three . '' He motioned now with his hands , two , one , point . The planet Earth , as well as the various refugee ships able to pick up the signal , is now at his attention . "
" `` People of Earth , I greet you and thank you for tuning in . My name is Paul Abrams , and I have been delegated by the United Nations to lead you for the months to come . As many of you know , an asteroid impact due to arrive in seven month 's time has the potential to cause an impact winter , blocking the sun from lighting and heating the earth for many years . We have sent off billions of humans to our galactic colonies , and unfortunately not all of us could make the trip . '' I allowed a break not for the audience , but for myself . My family did not make it onto any ship . My wife , my children , even my parents were probably huddled somewhere in a New York slum , listening to my broadcast . No one could find it possible to take them to a colony , not even the UN officials that worked so closely with me , not even after I was elected leader of over a hundred million damned souls could my loved ones make it off .

" `` As a result , there will be a great change in how the laws and doctrines of the world work . The United Nations have worked together in the time we had to devise a plan for those of us left to brave it out . '' I cleared my throat , and looked down at the list in front of me . `` We have began building , in suitable areas , large underground shelters able to fit ten thousand people , along with enough rations to feed them for up to a year . In addition , each shelter will be fitted with its own garden that can provide for our nutritional requirements should the need arise . '' Thank god for the hydroponics boom . `` A list of shelters can and will be made available to you by your regional governments in the passing weeks . All shelters will close two weeks before the scheduled arrival of the asteroid . '' "
" A lump rose in my throat as I went on . `` Military personnel will be dispersed to major population areas ( 'Were there even any left ? ' I thought to myself ) to insure the stability of the area and the long-term survival of your regional government . Keeping order will be very important , and disruption of the order will result in a very strict crackdown on any movements seeking to work against the greater good . Patrols will be sent out into more rural areas on a weekly basis to ensure that all are safe and in compliance with mandatory protocol . '' Another pause . "
" `` In the coming weeks , local hospitals will offer euthanization services for those who seek them . '' I let out a shaky breath . `` Regional governments , if they choose to , may also seek the euthanization of people deemed unable to fully contribute to society during the impact winter . '' I shuddered in disgust , but I knew the intentions were objectively
SLAM ! The ringing steel doors echoed through the the hangar as Major Harvey Johnson marched smartly across the empty space . The cyber Intel team had been taken by surprise , as no inspection was scheduled for today . They all stood nervously as attention . A man with more stripes on his arms than the rest moved to intercept the major . "
" `` Major Johnson , sir ! '' He saluted with as much enthusiasm as he could muster . "
" `` Sergeant Taylor , is it ? Well , sergeant ... '' The major paused as he surveyed the cyber warfare unit standing at attention around their stations . `` Put your men at ease . '' "
" `` Platoon , Parade REST ! '' Taylor turned back around to address Major Johnson . `` Sir , I do n't believe we were notified of an inspection today . What can I do for you ? '' "
" Johnson moved in close to Taylor 's face ; so close , in fact , that the sergeant could feel the brim of Johnson 's cover touching his forehead . "
" `` Sergeant , you have a mole . I am here to coordinate the shut down of your entire unit and erase the servers stored here . Your team has 2 hours to comply . '' "
" `` With all due respect , sir , 2 hours does n't even give me enough time to verify these orders from SECDEF . If you will allow me to do my due diligence , I can have this unit RFT by end of business today . '' The sergeant steeled his gaze on the major , willing him to back down . Suddenly , the major took a step back , and pulled out his cell phone . He dialed a number , and handed the phone to Taylor . `` It 's for you . '' Taylor raised the phone to his ear . "
" `` Master Sergeant Taylor , this is Secretary Jass . I need your unit shut down by the end of the day . Everything erased . Nothing , and I mean nothing left . Because of the possibility of a mole , you must personally inspect each of your airmen for any information they may be attempting to steal . Can you get this done , or do I need to send Security forces in ? '' "
" `` Uhh ... Yes sir . Right away , sir . '' Sergeant Taylor handed the phone back to the major . `` I 'll get started immediately . '' "
 
" Returning to his desk , he noticed an email that had been distributed to the entire unit , Cyber7 eyes only . He opened the attachment and immediately regretted doing so . The file was a gay porn image , with a caption added to describe it . "

"
The great wars , of the Dwarves and Elves , were considered to be a myth . Even the eldest of Elves knew noting but peace . Stories of battles were present in both Dwarven folklore and ancient Elven scrolls , but those spoke of time so long ago no one could be certain of their accuracy . "
" The truth is , there were wars . Both races , were young , looking for their place in the world . When the fighting grew so violent that it threatened the stability of the whole world , they put their weapons aside . "
" Some twenty thousand years ago , the great peace treaty was singed . The Elves could build their cities in the flatland , and Dwarves got the mountains and the caves . The jungles were left to nature . "
" While at first they lived in isolation , they later learned to cooperate . The Elves mastered philosophy and theoretical sciences . Mysteries of existence were unlocked . They could improve their own bodies and visit far planes . "
" On the other hand , the crafty Dwarves , grew craftier and craftier . Their projects were more and more ambitious and required ever increasing power . To accommodate to the demands , Dwarves unlocked the secrets of the stars . "
" And while the mountains and the flat lands had so much going on , the jungle was not idle . New sentient beings emerged , the Humans . Both Elves and Dwarves had a soft spot for the new race . Their child-like curiosity drove them to the established races as they had so much to learn from them . "
" Some Humans joined the Elves whiles the others joined the Dwarves . The were accepted in both societies , livng amongst them in peace and prosperity . The two old races would meet , few times every century . And while that was enough for the long lived Dwarves and Elves , it meant many Humans never met the race that was not their host . "
" The Humans who lived in the mountains were not as strong or bold as the Dwarves . They always had the need to fit in with them . The Dwarves did like the Humans , but they also looked down on them as being young and primitive , not capable of the great works the Dwarves achieved . "
" One day those humans learned of Elves . But it was n't for the meeting of races nor from Dwarves . They stumbled into the deepest , oldest caves . Drawings were painted with blood on the ancient walls of the underground hall . Paintings of tall pointy eared creatures reading and killing their Dwarven friends . It was the Elves and they were the enemy . "
" In secrecy , group of Humans , used the star power to create a weapon so powerful it can destroy whole cities . Now the Dwavers ought to accept them as equal they thought . The launched their weapons at Eleven cities and the time of peace was over .
`` Were n't you suppose to take that blow ? '' "
 I looked at this irritating woman incredulously . Was she serious ? 
" `` It is good fortune you did n't , but I thought that Xavier Longwood would have protected Kane even if his men had abandoned him . '' "
 `` So you know of me ? '' I could n't help but respond . I looked at the trio of misfits who had accompanied this women into the Emperor 's suite . Two hulking brothers who had the IQ of a toad and some gangly archer had subdued the half dozen guards and two other councilmen who had been staying with the Emperor . 
" `` I memorized all of the important people in the Empire , why would n't the Emperor 's second be any different ? The man born a baker 's son and has spent fifty years becoming much more . '' Her sword was still pointing in my direction , so there was no way she trusted me . It was what it was . "
" I let out a sigh . `` Of course . '' I finally recognized her dark green hair , with a natural shading that I had only seen once before . `` You must be the daughter of that Planter fellow . The one who stabbed the emperor as Prince Arn since he had a forest razed . I 'm guessing this is your revenge ? '' I was only talking to avoid getting killed . This event had occured twenty years before , early in my infiltration into the Empire when the old emperor ruled "
" `` My father was not some fellow ! He was a protector of the forest , a title handed down since the true rulers of Scoren reigned , the Winchesters ! A forest your emperor destroyed for no good reason ! One of them many evil things you helped him do . You have served this empire for decades , and have stayed quiet as he ended thousands . Why should n't I kill you as you stand ? '' The heroine began to point her sword in a far more threatening manner . "
" `` Did you forget about Wallace and Monroe ? Or the Emperor 's youngest brother Stallone ? You have done nothing except ruin the end of the Empire . '' I began to work into my rant , but I was cut off . "
 `` Ruin the end ? I know what he was doing here . He was going to kill the Lamons ambassador and declare war on them for the resources of the Western Sea . And it would have been either fight for the Emperor or die ! '' 
" `` It was going to be a coup that ended the Kane empire you fools ! '' I realized the eyes of the allies to the hero in the room were on me , and that all others were dead . I was the last to enter this room with the former emperor to live . I was going to make the mercy count . "
" `` You have no idea who the ambassador from Lamons is , now do you ? '' "
" The four of them could n't help but shake their heads . The archer pointed his bow in the direction of Allen , one of the dead councilmen . `` No , we only got from spying on him the plot to kill him . '' He seemed the too honest type . "
 `` It is Sly Kane . '' 
 `` Impossible ! He was executed last year for defying the emperor ! He had no remorse for his nephew . '' 
" `` But I did , and forced another prisoner to take his place . And I sent him to Lamons , where he gathered the trust of the royalty and we continued our plot to end the Empire . So tomorrow , while the Emperor comes with 30 men and his close advisors , Lamons had brought 300 . It would have been a bloodbath that ended everyone relevant to the Empire . And as the highest ranking heir . Sly would have taken the throne and converted power into a parliament , much like Lamons is . But with the Emperor dead , those men I spoke of earlier will run and know something is up . The assault on Lamons will occur and many men and women will die to your overzealousness . '' "
" They looked shaken as I told them this , as I explained to them their folly . Then one of the oafs spoke . "
" `` But if we kill them , we still good ? '' "
" `` Huh ? You mean Wallace and Monroe and Stallone and the others that would have been there ? They are spread in multiple locations , with many a guard . Arn was arrogant and thought he would not be attacked and brought among his weakest with him . '' "
 `` But Lamons has 300 men you said . '' The oaf pointed a giant hole in my logic . 
" He was right . If we attacked now , this could be salvaged . `` Alright , but we must move fast . Stallone will be here shortly to speak with his brother , and he will alert the rest once he sees the dead . Sly is staying in a tavern not far from here , while Lamons decoy ambassador is three floors below . We must move quickly . '' I began to look at the heroine who still was pointing her sword threateningly at me . "
" She looked around
`` Floride ! '' I exclamed . That was the answer . It must have been suppressing the bacteria into a dormant stage all these years . Patient zero had bad hygiene , was pretty isolated far from civilization , but was around people when the we were all exposed to the bacteria . Though the early victims might have been through contact it was only once we lost running water that the number of infections exploded . I asked `` What are we going to do ? '' "
" Dr. Fredbotvonick smiled and said . `` We fluoridanate water in the river , then we fluoridate water in all river . '' "
" I had 17 shotgun shells from my dad 's closet left ( Bambi you did not die in vain ) , a small plastic can of gasoline for the scooter , a container of sodium fluoride . "
 `` Are you coming ? '' I asked 
" `` I can not . This is your job . Your fate . '' Fredbotvonick said , `` I need to rest . '' I saw the stack of local anesthetic at his desk and immediately understood .
`` Have you ever had the chance to live out your fantasy ? Because I have . I 'm staring into the window of that bitch with only the piss yellow glow of a single street light to keep me warm . Today I will complete my mission . '' *CRASH* The shards of glass from the back window clatter on the ground . I hold my breath and stand in silence , my heart pounding so hard in my chest that I 'm sure she can hear it . After a long and gut wrenching pause I hear nothing but silence . It 's is the loudest silence , deafening even . I slowly reach in and unlock the dead bolt , careful no to scratch myself . I take another beat and check the windows around me . Darkness . Perfect . <newline> Cont ? <newline>
He woke up with cracked lips and the taste of iron on his tongue . Rubbing a pain from his neck , he pushed himself up from the couch , a headache rushing to greet him like an unrelenting wave ; he was parched . "
" After a few moments , he trudged to the faucet across the room and placed a cup under it , setting the plunger in its place over the drain as a precaution . He turned the knob and ... nothing . Right . His tank had run out three days past , a detail shrouded by the steady throbbing in his head . "
" And there would be no relief . Rains had n't come for over a decade and efforts to resupply any region within a thousand miles of the equator had been abandoned . The heat was intense , the solar flares constant and unabated . Radiation had driven the land to desolation . And the population had moved on , searching for respite closer to the poles as any sane person would . But he could n't , not while she was still here . "
" He looked out the window above the sink , glancing at the carved flagstone set upright in the shadow of his old barn across the way . The rust-colored dirt spreading to the horizon was an easy testament to the harshness of it all . His fists clenched at the thought of his past , and pushed away from the counter toward the door . "
" He stepped outside , the early sun 's gaze nearly searing his flesh . He looked toward the flagstone again and made his way over , sitting beside the mound in front of it and read the inscription : "
 *Dearest Alexandria Ensel* 
" *Beloved wife , you are my everything* "
" Thirteen years it had been , and each day he had spent time by her grave , with that time growing ever longer since the migrations . He had n't much else to do , after all . "
" `` I 've finally ran out , Alex . No more food , no more water . Soon we shall meet again to the sight of green pastures and blue skies . I have longed for it , though I have been afraid . Please , take my hand now and guide me to our new world . '' "
" He knew she would n't be fond of his decisions . Her words a few weeks before she passed kept coming back to him . `` *Live , * James . I will be there to pull you through the gates , when the time comes . But do not waste yourself in grief or guilt . Travel . Learn . Do not stay here . '' Well , he was selfish and he had n't left . He could n't leave . "
" Tears tried to come , but all was dry . In a moment , blackness took him ... "
" He awoke once more to the sun directly overhead , frustration building within him . He rolled to his knees and looked at the grave once more . `` I 'm ready . Take me , give me salvation ! '' he yelled , slamming the side of his clenched fist on packed dirt , and it *sunk in , * coming out lathered in mud . "
" He reeled back , shocked . How long it had been since he felt wet . Furrowing his brows , he crawled back and plunged a finger into the small patch that was already shrinking in the heat . It was so cool . He spread the mud on his forearm and readied his fist for another pound , too exhausted to consider the true oddity of what he had done . This time , as it swung , he saw a trail of particles arcing behind his fist , as if materializing out of the air . He stopped the swing and the particles caught up , dousing his arm and creating a light sheen . "
" He glanced at the grave , hopelessness taking him . He heard her words repeating again , *Do not stay* . "
" `` So this is to be my deliverance , '' he said . And he knew she was right . What use to give up on his world , their first home ? It was not fair for her , and he had wasted far too long in the realization . `` I 'm sorry , Alex . '' "
" He licked the water evaporating from his arm , yielding instant relief and offering him a renewed vigor . He reached both hands toward the sky , feeling the water drifting , minute . He grasped , and *pulled , * collecting the water into a small ball before him . It floated there , shifting in the air until he directed it into his mouth , letting it slosh around before swallowing . "
" He patted the grave and stood slowly , making his way toward the barn . Years of dust shook off the tarp as he uncovered his old motorcycle . He had kept it in case he ever found the courage to leave , a long abandoned prospect . He filled the tank and set the spare gas into a storage container attached to the back , where he found two cans of beans and some wax-covered cheese that he had forgotten about . It would have to do . He just hoped he could find some additional materials along the way . Fortunately , the engine started and he had naught but gas , beans , cheese , and the clothes on his back to take
It did n't make sense . In the dead of night , when the waters calmed from the great storm , I heard the lapping sound of a swimmer in the water coming towards me . The moon was peaking over the horizon shedding the caps of the waves with a white glow . It was indeed what I thought I was hearing . The object splashed against the whitecaps and made its way towards me . "
" The last clouds from the storm flew across the sky , to reveal the stars and Milky Way . It was a beautiful sight as the object reached the edge of my boat . "
" Part of me was curious who it may be , while a greater part of me was completely mortified . Its hand reached over like a wet towel being slung across the top of a lounge chair and a few seconds later a head popped up . "
" `` Ey , ya , would you help up ? '' said a young man 's voice , the moonlight shining behind his head . "
 I scrambled to grab his hand and pulled him into the boat . He was in nothing but a swimsuit and did n't look to be above the age of 25 . 
" `` Thanks , '' he said , finding a comfortable corner in the boat to lay in . `` Quite the storm , huh ? '' "
" `` Yeah , '' I said . `` I was almost out of food and water before the storm and then it hit . Now I 'm completely out . '' He gave a little chuckle . "
" `` I 'm Rudy , '' the man said , giving a brisk wave of his hand . `` I 'm sorry I did n't carry some food and water with me . I thought for sure I would n't be seeing anyone out here tonight . '' "
" `` Rudy ? '' I said . `` Ha , that 's my favourite movie . You heard of it ? '' "
" `` Of course . Happens to be one of my favourites too , '' he said , sitting up . "
" `` What were you doing out here , by the way ? '' I asked . `` I did n't see any ships in the storm . '' "
" `` Oh , I just happen to follow storms quite a bit . You could say I like to clean up the messes they leave behind . '' "
" I noticed then how cold the night truly was . Wrapped around me was my Thermo blanket and it was keeping me warm , but Rudy had nothing but a swimsuit . "
" `` Are n't you cold , '' I asked . `` I think I have another blanket in my emergency kit . '' "
" `` Me ? Heck , no . I do n't get cold , '' he said . `` Nope , nope , the cold does n't bother me . '' "
" `` So you 're like that marathon runner that runs shirtless in the winter time , '' I said . `` The Iceman , I think his name is ? '' "
 Rudy laughed again . `` I guess you could say that . But the 'man ' part might be a bit of a stretch . '' 
 His comment caught me off guard . I looked at his with a more careful eye as the moon grew higher in the sky . Somehow I never noticed the set of wings on his back . 
 `` You 're an angel ? '' I asked . 
" `` Yes , Alex Nuible , '' he said . `` The passage into death is a traumatic one , but every so often we get the chance to see death coming in people . You 've been out to sea for awhile now and with that storm , it was all but definite that the storm would take you . '' "
" I realized then the reason I could n't remember seeing any ships during the storm was because I could n't remember the storm . I remember seeing the flashes of lightning on the horizon and the rising waves , but then there was nothing . "
" `` Careful ! '' Rudy yelled . `` Think too hard and you will remember the pain , the disparity . I 've cradled you away from that . Let us start the journey to paradise . '' "
" `` How do I know this is n't a dream ? '' I asked . `` If I ca n't remember it happening , how do I know it 's real ? '' "
" `` You do n't need to know , '' said Rudy . `` The pain will be excruciating , but after you come with me you will see over time that what I 've said is true . Right now reality feels like a dream . It will subside after you 've had time to see that ... you 're not waking up . '' Rudy stood up with a solemn expression and walked towards me with his hand extended . "
" I could not accept , though . Even if this was n't a dream , I had to see the truth . I had to know , without a doubt , my end had come . With a burst of speed , I stood up and jumped into the fridged water . The memories came flooding back . "
" I saw the great waves of the storm , rising among the lightning . They rocked my boat violently as
This is my first one of these , so be gentle . "
" Everything Burns . <newline> This is the truth that Humans as a species forgets . <newline> Chicago , London twice before that , and Rome again before that . <newline> Catastrophes like those rare as they are remind us that as humans we can be wiped away by nothing but the whisper of smoke in a burning build or a blaze of roaring red . <newline> Though , we are a resilient bunch and can reduce these burning deaths to embers ... however what if ... we could n't ... <newline> We should 've seen the signs earlier . <newline> An increase in house fires , then wildfires .

`` I 've gotten myself into quite a pickle , '' my client told me , `` So I 'm trying to get rid of some loose ends . '' "
" I simply assumed he did some crime , got away , and did n't want his partners to rat him out . I 've gotten these kinds of jobs before . Standard . Simple . Kill some poor asshole that got himself into a sticky situation . "
" Holy shit , was I wrong . "
" I went to the address disclosed for me . I found myself standing in front of small house , the wooden shutters decaying from time . The stairs on the porch looked like they were about to crumble if I coughed on them . For all I cared , the house could have been a pile of rocks , as long as I still got paid . "
" The instructions I were given dictated me to knock on the door and follow the person that answered it . So I did . A pale man with a well-tailored suit silently greeted me into the abode . He simply began walking and I followed after closing the door behind me . I was alert , on edge , ready to take on my job . <newline> My instructions went on to detail how the man would lead me into a basement , where I was to receive further orders . I went downstairs . I thought I was prepared for whatever sight would greet me . What I saw then , I still ca n't explain today . It was just a job . "
" I found my client . Twice , in fact . At once . I instantly recognized his face from the news ; he was a suspect in a bank robbery , and right now , he seemed pretty fucking guilty . He stood in the dingy basement , a huge duffle bag of what I assumed was cash behind him , and next to a chair with a restrained man . The man was an exact copy of him . Spot on , the beard , the hair cut , the small mole on his left cheek . "
" `` Hi , '' the 'him ' standing up said , `` I 'm sure you have a lot of questions . '' "
" I did , but that was unprofessional . I shook my head in response . I just wanted to get this weird shit over with . `` Good , '' he said , `` I need you to kill me . THIS me ! '' He quickly corrected . "
" He continued , `` Yeah , I 'm sure you recognize me . I just pulled off a heist . I needed to be in two places at once , so I made a clone . '' "
 I only thought how . 
" `` I 'm pretty scientifically talented , '' he said in reply to my confused expression , `` I want you to kill him . It . Me , whatever the fuck . I 'm tying up loose ends . '' "
 `` Why would you hire a hit man to do it ? '' I asked . 
" `` Look man I 'm a bank robber , but not a murderer . Plus he looks just like me ! Think you 'd be able to do the same ? Just do the job and I 'll pay you , dude . '' "
" I looked at the clone sitting in the chair , tied up . He looked at me with tired , red eyes . His sorrowful expression . `` Do n't do it man , '' he said , `` He 's lying . I remember everything in my life . I 'm an actual person . *He's* the clone ! Have some god damn morals ! '' "
" `` I 'm just doing a job , '' I replied . "
 `` I 'll pay you too ! '' He shouted back before being silenced by a punch to the face by the standing man . 
" The two started yelling back and forth . At me . At each other . I zoned out , closed my eyes . I blocked them out and drew my gun . "
 -- -- -- 
 The news was interesting the next day . `` BANK HEIST SUSPECTS FOUND ! TWIN BROTHER ALSO INVOLVED ! THREE BODIES AT SITE ! MONEY NOWHERE TO BE FOUND ! '' The headlines read . 
" I parked my new car at my new house . I still had some junk money left over . It would take a while for the rest to be laundered , but it would last me the rest of my life if I was smart about it . All my loose ends were tied and I covered my tracks . Some other poor bastard would be getting arested for what I did . After all , the event was just a job , and I still got paid in the end .
My diet is strictly liquid . You guys have heard of that Soylent shit , right ? Same thing , more or less . Everything I need . All the nutrients and electrolytes and whatever-the-hell that keep my system in running order . Each daily dose spread across three separate bottles . It ’ s been that way ever since the shit-monsters materialized . "
" Taking liquid shits isn ’ t so bad , I guess . I had to move from single-ply economy toilet paper to extra soft to extra soft plus moisturizing lotion to baby wipes . But there ’ s a bear on the box and it looks kinda cute sitting on the cistern of my toilet . Plus I don ’ t have to worry about which direction to place the roll , so I guess I ’ ve got that going for me . "
" But Jesus . I hate . Hate hate hate hate . Hate more than I have hated anything else . Hate more than I hate terrorism and ebola and Donald Trump ’ s political campaign . Fucking hate the lack of variety in my meals . Sure , I ’ ve lost fifteen pounds . Sure , it ’ s cheaper in the long run . And sure , I don ’ t have to deal with the hassle of finding a new home for my crying , screaming shit-monsters . But I really miss solid food . Real food . Food I can chew up . Steak . Crusty warm bread with the soft chewy inside that I have gnash with my molars into a glutenous blob before I can swallow it down . It ’ s awful . "
" So , I cheated . "
" Most people have a slip-up now and then . And yeah , if I ’ m honest with you right now , I don ’ t regret it one bit . So sue me . I wanted food of substance . It ’ s a natural desire . We ’ re fighting millions of years of evolution here , folks . It ’ s not like I committed some kind of cardinal sin . My teeth and the little biome in my stomach didn ’ t evolve to process this synthetic liquid garbage . "
" Finding solid food is hard if you don ’ t know where to look for it . There are still fringe groups of traditionalists who have all run outside to live off the grid and off the land , but they ’ re a select few and kind of culty . That weird stuff always freaks me out . And you can always find someone in some alley somewhere who ’ s got an old bag of Skittles , but that ’ ll cost you an arm and a leg and you might end up getting shot for it . But I ’ m just a normal guy . I don ’ t wan na do some backalley deal or sell my soul to some random Jim Jones wannabe asshole in Backwater , Utah ( pop . 43 ) . "
" And so I found myself on Darknet buying a six year-old can of SpaghettiOs for the equivalent of 150 bucks in cyptocurrency . Not a great deal , but not awful either . Plus they promise me prompt and discreet shipping . Worth every penny . "
" When the food arrived on my doorstep in a plain brown box with no identifying marks for my privacy , I was fuckin ’ floored . I scooped it up and took it into my kitchen . I drew closed the shades and made sure my blinds were shut . I opened up the can and dug in with my fingers , eating handful after handful of lukewarm SpaghettiOs . "
 It was glorious . The gritty blandness of chugging down bottle after bottle of Generic Human Dietary Fluid 2A-3E was a shadow of a nightmare in my mind . I crushed the noodles in my teeth and slurped up their tomato-y substrate . This is what we were meant to eat . This is real food . 
" But now I ’ m sitting in my car with my hands on the steering wheel—parked and waiting . There are picketers with angry signs moving up and down the block . Scary picketers . Violent , religious nutjobs . I want them to leave . The sign above the door of the building I ’ m parked outside of reads Planned Evacuation . My stomach churns and rumbles . It ’ s not used to solid food . "
" I wait for the line of picketers to move as far away from the door as possible before I undo my seatbelt and make my way out of the car . I bet if I told you five years ago that prune juice was going to be considered an abortifacient , you would have laughed your fucking head off . <newline>
It was a Monday morning when I woke up , groggy from a short sleep . The sky was still dark and all was quiet , so it came to my surprise that my dad was awake in a sort of silent trance , his eyes bloodshot and full of rage . "
" `` I ca n't believe this , '' he said , `` this whole country has gone to shit ! '' "
" `` Morning , dad . '' I replied . The TV had its sound muted but what he was angry at was quite obvious . It was on the news channel and the headline *ZUAFFYUL X-2739 ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES* I was wholly indifferent to politics , I had no opinion on the matter . "
" `` Do you understand what this means , son ? '' His voice sounded genuinely scared , which I felt was an overreaction . `` We 've got to leave the country . This is the first step in a slippery slope . Eventually he 's going to announce the genocide of humans to massive applause . And we voted for him ! Ha ! '' "
 I decided not to argue as I needed to get ready for school . My phone beeps as I brush my teeth - text message from Zeolharxyon `` Z '' Y-6357 . I picked up my phone and read it . 
" `` Parents are crying . Never thought that this day would come . So happy right now , see you at school . '' "
" Z was my best friend at school . The fact that today , for the first time ever , one of his kind was elected president made me extremely happy . I made sure to hide this happiness from my father the rest of the morning before heading to school .
He stood there , looking as his own grave . "
" Fog hung low in the air , the visceral substance forming an eerie wall around the lonely cemetery . "
" The dirt caked on his boots seemed to weigh him down , anchoring the dejected man to his spot . Even if he wanted to run , he would be tethered here by obligation . "
" `` Do it , Francis . '' A voice sounded somewhere behind the troubled man , but he did n't turn around to acknowledge it . Yet for some reason , it continued to speak . `` You know why you 're here . We all know why . '' "
" The man could hear footsteps behind him , yet he still did n't turn . "
" `` You *killed* her , Francis . It 's all your fault . '' "
" `` No . '' The man uttered the word feebly at first , unsure of its validity . He said it again , this time more firmly . `` NO . '' "
" Turning around , Francis confronted his accusers . The gaunt face of a woman stared hard at him ; behind her stood myriad cloaked individuals , their faces hidden from view . "
" `` Jessica is dead and it 's all your fault , Francis . '' "
 `` It was n't my fault . You 're wrong . '' 
 `` It was . You simply ca n't admit it . You can never take responsibility . '' 
 `` Shut UP ! You have no idea what you 're talking about- '' 
" `` I know *exactly* what I 'm talking about ! '' The woman began to move in closer to Francis , her tone becoming more and more menacing . `` The whole town knows what you 've done ! *She* knows what you 've done ! '' "
" The woman pointed past Francis at the grave he had been pensively considering prior . The man turned , wide-eyed in horror . "
" A small child , a girl , was climbing out of the grave , eyes sunken , skin pale . Her matted hair obscured her features , but Francis knew exactly who she was . He wanted with all his being to scream , to run , to move from the spot where he currently stood . But he could n't . He was anchored in place . "
" `` NO . '' The only word that the man could say began to sound like a confirmation . `` No , no , no , no NO ! '' "
" The child grabbed Francis by his shirt , ripping the man forward , shattering his unseen tether . She pulled him to the edge of the grave , just enough for him to lose his balance . The man toppled over the edge , crashing down to the earthen floor below . "
" `` I 'm sorry , '' Francis sobbed . He laid in the dirt , curled up in a fetal position . `` I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm *so* , *so sorry* . '' "
" The man stayed there for a while . He had no grasp on the passing of time . When he finally raised his head , there was no girl , there was no crowd gathered at the edge of the grave , there was no woman with her sharp words . "
" Just him , his guilt , and his grave .
`` So that 's why , Mr. President , '' I said , `` They call it 'super-sized ' . It 's all because Ray Kroc had a philosophical fling with Nietzche when he was younger ! I mean , can you believe it ? '' "
" The president looked at me with wide eyes , his jaw hanging open . "
" `` My goodness , '' he said , `` I did not know that , and I would n't have believed it if I had n't heard it from you . '' He picked up his scotch and kicked back what was remaining and slammed the heavy glass down . He poured himself another and held up the bottle and shook it at me . "
" I nodded and he poured me one as well , a heavy pour . "
" `` And you know , '' he said , `` That 's probably how they came up with Superman too . '' He dropped two chunks of ice in his drink , one chunk in mine . `` Nietzche . Chiristopher Reeve as Nietzche and all that , I betcha . '' "
" `` Actually , '' I said , `` the creator of Superman named hero that after the drycleaner he used to take his shirts to get pressed . The place was called Super Men 's Super Shirts and Laundry . Made 'em famous . '' "
" Well shit , he said , `` Is n't the world just great ? '' "
 He poked his left hand at the pocket of his trousers a few times before it found its way in and withdrew a pack of smokes . He asked me if I wanted one and I said sure and we picked up our drinks and walked over to the open French doors . He flipped me a cigarette and I lit them both . 
" `` Shit , '' he said , `` Is n't it a pretty night ? '' He looked out at the rose garden and exhaled a plume of smoke . I nodded . He looked down at his hand . "
" `` I wish these damned things were n't so addictive , '' he said , `` Or that even if they were , they were n't bad for you . '' I nodded again and took a long swig of the scotch . "
" `` You know , '' I said , I just read a study out of MIT that found that they are n't bad for you at all ... that they 're kind of healthy for you . '' "
 `` No shit ? '' he said . 
" `` No shit , '' I replied . `` They found that they actually improve your lung capacity , and they put hair on your chest . '' "
 The president took a deep drag on his cigarette and closed his eyes . I absent-mindedly scratched my chest and took another drink . He open his eyes and blew out the smoke . 
" `` Well if this is n't nice , what is ? '' he said .
I want to share with you something that I discovered about myself that rekindled my passion for writing . You need to fall in love with yourself and the words coming out of you . It 's very easy to get bored with writing , your plot , whatever . Writing , like cooking , needs herbs , spices and variety . If you cook a frozen burger adding nothing extra , that burger is going to be plain . "
" I use the burger analogy when explaining writing to friends . I ask them : Which sounds better ... A ) Jack put a frozen burger on the grill . After a while , it was done and he ate it . Or B ) Jack had before him a bowl . Ground sirloin beef was mixed with a beaten egg , Italian bread crumbs , worcestershire sauce , minced garlic and a few pinches of cayenne pepper . The charcoal grill had already been burning red hot when he added the soaked hickory woodchips on the fire . The patties were seared as the flames licked the side of the meat . He took a swig of the whiskey , it warmed his belly and reminded him of his father . He had always said a man should never grill sober . "
" The freshly done burgers had perfect grill lines across both sides . He had only flipped them a single time , it 's the rule . They had been topped with a thick slice of cheddar cheese , three slice of bacon and a single leaf of lettuce . You had to get veggies in your system , somehow . He had baked the sourdough buns himself , they had been timed to come out of the oven just moments before the food was off the grill . It would be a satisfying meal , the juices of the hot meal running down the sides of his hands . The satisfying crunch of the bacon mingling with the slightly burnt texture of the scores from the steel grating of the grill . "
 -- -- -- - 
" I know , it 's a long example . When I explain it to friends ... when I explained it to myself , even ... I learned that I love making that fully realized burger . I like putting that piece of freshly done food in their mouth . You 've got to rekindle that interest in cooking up a story . You need to figure out what flavors you actually like . If you start but never finish anything , you need to diagnose what that is . Are you not interested in the final product ? Then you 're cooking the wrong story . Are you vested in the final product , but the work to get to that end is n't satisfying ? You need to start mixing in different ingredients , adding flourishes , seeing things that other people do n't see or do n't give much attention to . "
" Bottom line : You need to make things interesting for you . Challenge yourself to make even the most mundane thing , like cooking a burger , sound interesting . Otherwise it will taste as bland as it feels . I hope this helps .
https : //m.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4douba/wp_aliens_have_landed_and_are_instilling_everyone/ <newline> It 's been a 2 days now since the Zurbans arrived on earth . "
 They had been observing us for 200years until it was time to `` reward '' a species that had allowed diversity and balance to develop in their society . 
" We were all sceptical at 1st but after President Obama was shot with the ray of potential and addressed the world telepathically , well everybody took notice . "
 In his address he explained that the reward from the Zurbans would be realising the full potential of an ability that would better you as a human in your line of work or general life . 
" My names Jeff and I 'm an unemployed stoner that plays video-games , reads comic books and watches Netflix all day . "
" I was sitting at home when the ray it me , later that day my best friend Tony from up the street came by to see what I had been rewarded with , he was a firemen . "
" Tony . <newline> `` Hey Jeff , what power did the Zurbans give you ? '' "
 Me . <newline> `` Why do n't you tell me what yours is 1st ? '' 
 Tony . <newline> `` Well it 's kinda like I can control fire and make it go wherever I want . '' 
" Me . <newline> `` No way man , prove it . '' "
" Tony . <newline> `` Well ok , I 'm still getting used to it though . <newline> You got a lighter ? '' "
 Me . <newline> `` Yeah man here you go . '' 
" Tony . <newline> `` Thanks , now watch this . '' "
" Tony flicks the lighter until a flame sprouts up , he then waves his other hand over the naked flame and it immediately starts to form a sphere of smooth orange and blue heat , getting bigger in mass by the second . "
 Tony . <newline> `` Pretty awesome huh ? '' 
" Me . <newline> `` Woah dude , that 's nuts you 're just like Pyro . '' "
 Tony . <newline> `` Yeah pretty sweet huh ? <newline> So what 's your ability ? '' 
 Me . <newline> `` Well ... .you know how your abilities are meant to help you out in what you do day to day ? '' 
" Tony . <newline> `` Yeah like how I 'm a fireman that can control fire , or how Steve down at the Zoo can talk to animals . '' "
" Me . <newline> `` Yeah exactly , well because all I do is use the internet for streaming and gaming . <newline> My ability is I always have a perfect internet connection . '' "
 Tony . <newline> `` What do you mean exactly ? '' 
" Me . <newline> `` It 's pretty simple , whatever device I use to connect to the internet on always has the best possible connection . '' "
" Tony . <newline> `` Really ? Well that sounds useful , can you connect yourself to the Internet ? because that 's awesome . '' "
 Me . <newline> `` No I can only connect through a device . '' 
 Tony . <newline> `` Well can you at least do it wherever you want ? Like just fire up a laptop in the middle of the woods and watch some sweet Kung fu movies on Netflix . '' 
" Me . <newline> `` Again no , it already has to have some kind of internet connection for me to make it perfect . '' "
 Tony . <newline> `` Hey at least you wo n't have anymore buffering though huh ? <newline> Cs man that 's annoying . '' 
" Me . <newline> `` Yeah I guess , I 'll always have good ping gaming as well . '' "
" Tony . <newline> `` Sure yeah , you 'll always have the drop on everyone in the lobby , get that sweet prestige before all the nubs . '' "
" Me . <newline> `` Yeah man , I 'll be the best player on every server . So you up for a quick game of COD ? '' "
" Tony . <newline> `` Actually man I 'm going to keep practising my new ability , you know show this fire who 's boss , <newline> You wan na watch me ? '' "
" Me . <newline> `` That 's ok , I 'm going to get some game time in and get that prestige emblem . '' "
" Tony . <newline> `` Oh ok buddy , well I 'll swing by later in and see what a perfect internet connection is actually like then . <newline> See ya . '' "
" Me . <newline> `` Yeah man , we 'll own for sure . <newline> Catch you later on then . '' "

I was ushered into a dark room , where I see a man sitting in the dark wearing a black suit and his gold chain shining in what little light is in the room . I 'm thrown onto the ground . I know why I 'm here . The last words I want to hear come out of his mouth `` Where my money ? '' I start crying trying to explain where my mom has went . BAM ! I get kicked in the face . `` WHERES MY FUCKING MONEY ! ? '' "
" Two weeks later , I 'm sitting in my apartment shaking from withdraw . I have been doing cocaine for too damn long . All my money is being sucked away by this terrible habit formed from parting to much . `` What have I done ? '' The sweat drips down my forehead as I hear my phone buzz . I pick it up . The text reads `` You want some more of the good stuff ? '' A giant smile grows on my face . I respond letting my dealer know that I 'm in dire need of a hookup but , spent all of my money earlier . Kevin , my dealer , texts back with `` I can give you some now , but , you 'll have to pay more when you do get money . '' I agree . I get the cocaine and never speak to him again . "
" Two weeks later . My door gets a knock on it . I have no clue who could be at the door at 9 p.m . I try to look through my peep hole , but , its shattered . I open the door cautiously . I 'm punched and I fall to the ground . I catch a glimpse of two people in leather jackets before I pass out . I wake up in the back of a car . I have no clue what is going on . We stop . The trunk opens and a man in staring at me . He pulls me out and drags me into a building I had never seen . The smell of his cologne could cover a dumpster . I was ushered in and thrown onto the floor . "

The stark chords of Tosca begin once again ; Scarpia ’ s motive is the first thing the audience at La Scala Opera hear . Perhaps they are jaded by it , but it still elicits within me feelings from a bygone life . Soon we ’ ll see entrances from Cavaradossi and of course our leading lady , Tosca , forced to do the unspeakable and murder one man to try and save another ’ s life . Poor Tosca ; if only she had known that Cavaradossi was truly given a stay of execution , perhaps she would have accepted Scarpia ’ s demand for intimacy . <newline> The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre , lazily critiquing the same show that they ’ ve seen entirely too often here in Milan , and go out to the cafés and restaurants that they ’ ve been to many times before . Their lives , seemingly on a loop , continue at their leisurely pace as I sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watching the days pass by . <newline> Acquaintances of mine always asked , “ Why move to Milan ? ” “ You don ’ t know Italian , do you ? ” “ Why now ? ” they ’ d ask with all the sincerity of a Hallmark Valentine ’ s Day card . I ’ m not sure that I ’ d ever have an answer for them , because they were right to question my motives . Why choose to fundamentally change the eternal workings of the vampiric lifestyle ? <newline> For one , the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o ’ clock in the morning , meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint . However , even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life , how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish : garlic . <newline> Oh the dreaded aglio . For so often I took it for granted during my time in Vienna . Stakes could be easily enough avoided with good planning ( an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my face and the world that might wish to destroy me ) , but the Austrians never bothered with garlic quite as often as they do here . <newline> Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful . Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart , or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner ’ s `` Der Vampyr . '' But for now , I sit like Tosca , in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again . Now , this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone ’ s lips . <newline>
`` Just a little further '' Stasi said as they walked through the forest . Miyakel was breathing hard , half from the quick pace his sister kept , half from fear of the unknown . Their father told them to stay away from this place ; that a powerful wizard put a poisonous spell from all who entered . Normally they would heed papa 's advice , but when the Smif sisters called them cowards them at school on Godday , he and his sister were compelled to travel here to save face from embarrassment . "
" They pass over a creak , and Stasi warned her sibling to not drink from it . `` We do n't know how the wizard poisons people who come here , but it 's best to avoid eating or drinking anything . '' Miyakel dreaded the thought of getting sick and having to reveal the truth to father , so he resisted the urge to quench his thirst . "
" Their path was overgrown , but manageable . The ground was more covered than the roads in their town , but was too straight to be a coincidence . It was obvious , even to a child , that this once was created by people as a passage way for many folk . He envisioned a time when it was clear and large caravans traveled through this area in horses and carriages down this road . "
" Suddenly his sister put her hand out on his shoulder , and became instantly silent . Miyakel froze , worried that they had come across something sinister . Slowly , she pointed with her other hand . The young boy slowly followed with his eyes until he saw it . A metal pole , twice the his height with a sign on it . Metal was rare , and never used for such a luxury as a sign . "
" The writing was grey and dirty , but somehow Miyakel knew at one time they were colorful , that time had eroded all the brilliance the sign once had . He could n't read the ancient text , some of the letters were clear like ( CBL ) , while other appears backward ( R ) or upside down ( A ) . Nonetheless the sounds he could construct from it made no sense to him . "
" However , he was transfixed by the symbol . It was a triangle , with what appeared to be a circle . However the circle was an illusion . It was circle but every other 1/6 was missing . Additionally the center was showing , but a ring around the center was also removed . Something had made this sign , and it did so very deliberately . Although he had never seen it before , this symbol was foreboding . His mind was fearful of the alien design . "
" Miyakel held his sister 's hand and tilted his head back toward the village . He had seen enough and wanted to go home . Mother would be making a fresh batch of bread , and they still had firewood to gather for the stove . Stasi apparently felt the same . This was as far as they were willing to go . However she pulled out some paper and the piece of sharpened coal that father had gotten her from last Spring 's carnival . She copied what she saw , hoping that one day she could make sense of the sign . After she finished , he watched her carefully open her satchel and place in it the paper that read : `` WARNING CHERNOBYL AHEAD . ''
`` Do n't forget to ask her . '' "
 `` I wo n't grandmother . '' 
" Bobby loved his grandmother very much , but was a bit puzzled by his grandmother 's strange request . He thought , `` why should I ask the fortune teller directly what is the most important decision I will ever make and , specifically , what is the date when I will die . '' "
 Bobby opened the door to the fortune teller 's studio . It was a dark place with all the gaudy Gypsy touches that one would envision in a fortune teller 's lair . 
" `` Come on in , Bobby . Please have a seat . You do n't mind if I call you Bobby , do you ? '' Bobby thought that the fortune teller was quite deliberate in her tone so moved quickly over to the velvet chair that looked like something from a cheap romance novel . Bobby sat up forward in the comfortable chair eager for his first exchange ever with a fortune teller in his entire life . "
" `` Bobby , how would you like your fortune to be told ? Is there a question you would like me to address for you ? '' She leaned somewhat into the table towards Bobby who was already sitting forward in his chair , mesmerized by this force of nature he saw before him . "
" `` Sure , he started , `` I do have a line of thinking in mind . I would like to know , '' he hesitated for a moment , and continued , `` I would like to know what will be the most important decision I will ever make , and what will be the date of my death ? '' He felt a little weird asking that last part . Seemed so melodramatic . "
" Bobby noticed that the fortune teller 's attitude towards him changed but for a second , and then back , `` Sure , Bobby , let 's do look into those things . '' "
 The fortune teller pulled her crystal ball towards herself a bit and invited Bobby to lean even further into the table . 
" In a whisper the fortune teller continued , `` Bobby look into this crystal ball with me and let us seek what you wish to know . I , I see you sitting at a desk . You seem to be in deep thought , a tumbler of something sitting on your desk . Let me see . '' "
 The fortune teller leans into the crystal ball even further . 
" `` It is brandy . Bobby , do you see the brandy bottle on the credenza in the office ? You are a handsome man , Bobby . Can you see him ? The nameplate on the desk says 'Robert Bartholomew . ' I guess you go by Robert now . Do you see the nameplate , Bobby ? '' "
" `` Yes , I see the name plate . But I can not see myself . Why can I not see myself ? '' Even without the ability to see himself , Bobby was quite astonished that he could see the vision in the crystal ball . He always thought it was a joke played on gullible people . "
 `` That is because you are you . Sorry I can not fix that . '' Said as the fortune teller moves on with the telling . 
" `` You seem very sad , Bobby -- I mean Robert seems very sad -- I see an excess of water in his eyes and his eyes seem red as if he , you , were crying . '' "
" At this point , Bobby and the fortune teller were both mesmerized with the scene unfolding before them . Robert backs his chair away from the desk and turns towards a large credenza . Grabs a knob . Oh ! It 's not a drawer , but a cabinet . And the knob did n't pull out as one would expect , but glided along some type of rail to reveal a safe . "
" Robert slowly twirled the dial on the safe , first to the right , then to the left , and then back to the right again . Robert grabbed the handle , pulled downward , but the safe would not open . "
" Robert let out an audible , `` Fuck ! , '' and , while reaching towards his glasses , knocked his brandy glass off his desk . This time he did n't remark about his misfortune . Quickly he got a towel from his bathroom , dabbed up the brandy from the carpet for a moment , and said `` fuck it , what am I doing . '' He throw the towel into the chair across from his desk . Picked up the glass and poured another brandy . Took a quick , long drink . Put the tumbler on the other side of his glasses and grabbed his glasses on the glide path to his handsome face . "
" Robert sat back down at this desk , turned around and again set to twirling the safe dial , but this time preceded by a brisk set of long , left twirls , looked like three , proceeded by the usual right twirl with a more careful stopping at the arrival point of 10 , then to the left to 34 , and then back to the right , but this time to the number 17 . "
" Robert cranked the lever and this time it opened successfully . He reached into the safe , moved a folder with a good twenty
Claire discovered her ability when working on her first child . "
" She had worked on dozens of the deceased , but they all had either been elderly who died of natural causes , or middle-aged men and women who had n't taken care of themselves as they should have . Yes , there were a few who died of accidents , but those who had died had lived long enough to get something out of life . To have their first kiss , first love , first fight , first everything . "
" But the little boy who laid before Claire , naked except for a paper-thin white sheet covering his genitals , he had n't experienced anything except for the shit luck that the world had bestowed upon him . "
" `` Oh God , '' Claire said , covering her mouth with one hand , and pushing back the flap of skin that had folded down from his forehead and covered his left eye . It was there , that his head must 've collided with the asphalt . The rest of the family was fine after the car crash , but a faulty booster seat and faulty car door spelled doom for the three-year-old who would n't make it junior high , much less elementary school . "
" `` Oh *God* , '' Claire said again , this time with a hint of anger in her wavering voice . If there was a `` God '' , how in the hell could he ever let something happen to a child ? Someone who was too young to probably even understand what life and death was ? "
" Anger turned into rage , and Claire clenched her eyes . There in the darkness , she saw the Reaper , cloaked in the darkness of the insides of her eyelids , somehow managing to smile despite just being a skeleton in a robe , whispering `` I got this one , my dear , he is all mine , I will take care of him . '' "
" Never in her short career did Claire feel such rage . She opened her eyes and removed her quivering hand from her mouth and clenched it into a fist . She wanted to punch something . She raised her clenched fist high above her head , and for a split second , almost brought it down onto the dead boy 's chest . Claire stopped herself , though , a half-inch from the boy 's sternum . She sighed , feeling warm tears roll down her cheeks . It felt like an apple had lodged itself in her throat and it hurt to swallow . "
" `` Bullshit , '' she whispered , laying her hand on the boy 's sternum . It was then that she felt a heartbeat . "
" She jerked a hand back and yelped as the boy 's skin flashed . The scalped skin that was sagging across his face fixed itself back to the top of his head , and his eyeballs fluttered underneath his eyelids as if he were having a very vivid dream . "

" It did n't take long for her to realize that bringing the dead to life was taking it 's toll on her . At the age of 27 , she realized she was already starting to get wrinkles on her face . Her hair was thinning and turning grey , and it was n't too much of a stretch to say that she looked older than her own mother . "
 But it did n't stop Claire . 
" Every single time she was presented a child under the age of five , she performed a miracle . Things became difficult when people started learning of the undertaker who brought the dead to life , and countless times Claire had to move and change her name . "
" But the funny thing about it , the more Claire performed these miracles , the older she became , and with the aging , came the changing of her facial features . "
" One year , it was a young woman who had performed a miracle in bringing a girl who had been murdered by a pedophile back from the death , and the next year , it was an elderly woman , resurrecting a child who died from an peanut allergy . It was hard to keep track of who was doing the miracles . Claire became Elanor , Elanor became Ruth , and Ruth became Gracie , and so on and so forth . Soon , she was just picking names from her favorite books . "
 *** 
" Her last was n't a child . No , for her last miracle , Claire brought back a mother who died during childbirth . "
" She had never brought back an adult before . Never even thought about it . She had dealt with dead parents before , but never once did she pull one out from the clutches of the Reaper . "
" As she laid her hand between the woman 's cold bosom , Claire realized the reason she was doing it this time , was simply because she was tired . "
" She felt the last of her life escape her through the tips of her fingers , and Claire collapsed in the silent room . In her mind 's eye , she saw the Reaper come for her , still smiling the same smile from the day she performed her first miracle , but this time , Claire smiled back . "
" *You take plenty from this world , I know you do , but it must sting to know I took some back from you . * "

Two blurry colors were making zig zag motions around the city . One is yellow and the other red . The yellow one seemed to be ahead of the red one . It was Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen running against each other . The city seemed like it stood still in time compared to how fast these two were moving . "
" Barry was trying his best but he just ca n't seem to keep up . He thought he 'd done everything right . He gave away everything he possessed to charity and anyone else who needed it . He had nothing except for the suit on his body . But how come he 's still slower than his foe . Could it be ? Thawne is somehow more destitute than him ? But how ? He 's at zero . Could it be that Thawne owned someone money ? No , Barry has already tried that . He took a loan and got himself in debt to see if he got faster before he got into this fight and he did n't . The maximum power you can get from this power scheme is when you have nothing . Debts does n't account into it . But- "
 Thawne saw Barry 's confusion and took the advantage and swung at Barry hard . The Flash could n't react in time and got hit . It was a powerful punch . One of his teeth came off and Barry was thrown of course hard . He spun on the ground for several cycles and could n't stop himself . 
" `` Do you want to know why you 're losing , Barry ? You can feel it , do n't you ? You 're getting slower . '' said Thawne gleefully . Barry was in pain but he can still see how smug Thawne is . He was right though . He does feel more lethargic . What 's happening ? Barry is at his poorest , he ca n't be slowing down . Did Thawne do something ? "
" `` Look at your pocket , Barry . '' taunted the man in yellow . Barry was confused but did what Thawne told him to do anyway . There was something in pocket . Odd . It was paper . Barry hastily tore it out of his pocket and looked at it . It was a lottery ticket . Dated today . "
" `` It 's the winning lottery , Barry '' smiled Thawne . `` You 're rich now ! '' "
 `` How- '' 
" `` It was me all along , Barry ! Me ! '' Thawne was hysterical at this point .
He stared into the Distance , it would n't be long now ... he could feel the presence of the Red Flame ... and it would n't be long until he arrived . "
" Delta adjusted his helmet , as he stared into the green river below , the continual slush from the factory pouring in , tarnishing the clear blue coming from up river . "
" The factory was necessary for the production of the the metal Orentium , the only material capable of energy productive fusion on the planet . Unfortunately the byproduct was a chemical that could only be disposed of and deactivated in water , and as such the government had given them special permissions to dump in rivers as it saw fit , regardless of the toxic effects it had on the local area , and destruction of the local environment . "
" He arrived in a blazing fluorescent torrent of red fire , suitable to match the rage he currently held . Delta merely stood arms crossed at the top of the factory . "
" `` Delta , you know why I must do this , please move . Heroes should n't fight each other , and you know this company more than deserves it ... they have cost so many lives already.. '' "
" `` The second you deemed it allowable to attack this factory , was the second you lost your status as a hero . The law allows it , and it is within its right to operate , regardless of the circumstances . '' "
" `` BE REASONABLE DELTA ! This building has already killed thousands from its pollution in the area , how many more must die before you see this problem ? '' "
" `` You Narrow minded fool Red ... do you know what this factory produces ? Without it the energy requirements of this country would n't be satisfied , many more would die from the lack of energy . '' "
" `` Delta , there has to be another way . They will be forced to understand that if I destroy this facility , and never allow it to be rebuilt ... . '' "
" `` This world works off of give and take Red . The corporation does more harm than good , it may take lives but it gives even more back in exchange . The world is n't a fair place . This is n't some fairy tail universe Red ... There is n't some end-all be-all solution that will result in the perfect world for everyone . If you think so than you are a fool . '' "
" `` Do n't you have any morals Delta ? This is n't right . What 's more important , your loyalty to the law ? Or loyalty to the people in this country . '' "
" `` I have morals ... but I also have foresight , and respect for the law . Something you do not . It appears you do n't understand anything anymore . '' "
" `` Oh I understand , I understand that you 've become a pawn '' Red blurted as he coated his whole body in his trademark Flames . "
 Delta adjusted his visor and balled his fists . `` I have nothing more to say to a fool like you . You intend to break the law and I can not allow that . I 'll make sure to destroy your statues when you 're beat ... you do n't deserve them anymore . ''

" Red fired a beam of flame straight towards Delta , only to have it deflected by a single hand . The cool blue and grey of the defender 's uniform providing a stark contrast to the scorching flames . "
 `` Pathetic ... '' Quipped Delta `` My Turn . '' 
 Before Red could react Delta had appeared behind him and grabbed him by the neck . 
" `` I HAVE EXISTED FOR 600 YEARS BOY , YOU ARE NO MORE THREATENING THAN A MATCH TO ME . I HAVE SEEN THINGS YOU COULD N'T IMAGINE , AND THAT IS WHY I CAN DEFEND THIS FACTORY ... IT IS FOR THE GREATER GOOD . '' "
" Red engulfed his body in flames in a vain attempt to have the iron grip released . Delta Put his palm to the back of Red 's head and much to the shock of the burning hero the flames suddenly flowed into Delta 's hand , and slowly the fires of Red started to flicker and fade . "
 `` WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY FLAMES ? ! ? ! ? '' Questioned Red 
" `` I am merely giving them a more useful home . Do n't worry , I will use them well . '' Retorted Delta "
" Red 's fire had extinguished , his red uniform being the only aspect to identify him as the hero he once was . "
" `` I respect the law ... Red , If I thought the same way you did ... you would already be dead . '' "
 Red could feel the piercing gaze of Delta through the opaque visor . He never thought he could be defeated this easily . His mind had gone blank and there was nothing but regret in his mind . 
" `` You are subject to the law , like everyone else ... and you will be tried as such . Enjoy your time in prison . But know this ... . your biggest punishment will be regret . '' "

It was eight p.m. in DeFrayne ’ s Twenty-Four Hour Laundrette and quiet . The air was warm and snug like an old duvet , the only sound the gentle thrumming of the machines , and old DeFrayne himself was close to falling asleep amongst the boxes of detergent on the counter when the door opened . The cool night air and the rumble of tyres briefly intruded on the cosy scene , and with it came a man . "
" He seemed quite a shifty man , thought old DeFrayne to himself . Normal laundrettiquette was to walk in , give a friendly smile to the proprietor of the establishment , and busy yourself with your washing . This man was different . He darted in like a magnet might enter a fridge emporium – so quick DeFrayne had barely even seen him . No attempt was made at a friendly smile ; instead he skulked round the side of the laundrette in the shadow of the dryers as though desperate not to be noticed . When he came to a gap between the dryers he army-rolled across it . "
" DeFrayne left his position by the counter and approached the man . He was crouched by one of the washers , fingering the material of some brightly coloured spandex and muttering to himself , apparently quite on edge . He was dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe . "
 DeFrayne cleared his throat . “ Can I help you ? ” he asked gently . 
 The man screamed and burst into flames . 
" “ I know you ! ” DeFrayne said , three bottles of fire extinguisher and half a bottle of gin later . “ You ’ re whatshisname . Fire Man. ” "
" The man ’ s lips tightened before parting into a winning smile . “ Flame Man , ” he said , “ correct. ” "
" “ Ah yes , ” said DeFrayne , looking again at his charred laundrette and reflecting sadly that Fire Men tended to be better at putting out fires than causing them . “ Flame Man. ” He put on his best customer-service smile . “ What brings you and your flames to my laundrette ? ” "
" “ I was hoping to do some laundry , ” said Flame Man . He held up the brightly coloured spandex . “ My suit ’ s a bit , ah , dirty. ” "
" “ But of course. ” DeFrayne pointed to a set of instructions on the wall . “ Washers are three pounds , dryers are two. ” "
" “ It ’ s a bit complicated , ” Flame Man pressed . “ See here… ” He deposited the spandex on the counter and fiddled inside for the label . “ There ’ s this circle… and this circle inside this square… and this picture of a cupcake… and this ‘ B ’ with a cross over it. ” "
" “ Is this blood ? ” asked DeFrayne queasily , pointing to a large red stain on the suit . "
" “ No , ” Flame Man admitted . “ It ’ s jam. ” "
" “ Ah , that ’ s alright then. ” DeFrayne relaxed visibly , and turned his attention to the geometry – and cupcake – that had so baffled Flame Man . “ Let ’ s see… super low heat… only the mildest of detergent… ” His brow furrowed . “ Criminy… how much did this cost you ? ” "
" “ Got it on the cheap , ” Flame Man said proudly , puffing out his chest beneath his bathrobe . "
 “ I can tell. ” DeFrayne rubbed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and poured himself another gin . “ How can something flameproof require such a delicate wash ? ” 
" “ Look mate , I ’ m not Batman , ” Flame Man shot . “ I can ’ t afford all that high quality gear he has knocking about . Can you wash it ? ” "
 “ I… ” DeFrayne finished his gin . “ Why d ’ you need it washed anyway ? ” 
" “ I ’ m doing a birthday party tomorrow , ” Flame Man said . “ I can ’ t have all the kids thinking I ’ m covered in blood. ” "
 “ A birthday party ? ” DeFrayne looked at Flame Man in disbelief . “ I thought you fought crime ? ” 
" Flame Man raised his hands in the air . “ Like I said , I ’ m not Batman . I ’ ve got to pay the bills somehow. ” "
 This was too much for DeFrayne . “ No ! ” he snapped . “ I ’ m not spending my entire evening attempting to wash your suit for some girl ’ s birthday party just because you couldn ’ t eat your sandwiches sensibly ! ” 
" “ It was actually toast , ” Flame Man said haughtily . “ Not my choice. ” He eyed DeFrayne sadly . “ Are you saying you won ’ t clean my Super Suit ? ” "
" “ Yes , ” DeFrayne said coldly . “ That ’ s exactly what I ’ m saying. ” "
" Flame Man cast an eye over the deserted laundrette , with only the solitary machine thrumming away in the corner . “ Funny , ” he said . “ I would ’ ve thought you ’ d need the business. ” "
" “ There ’ s something about nutters setting fire to things that scares customers off , ” said DeFrayne . "

NEDD looked down at the rhythmic sound of wood clanging against your gargantuan cloven hoof . <newline> *sigh* what is the world coming to ? That this semi-naked warrior with nothing but a wooden sword had reached his domain meant the guardians of all the lower levels had failed to prevent this nobody to pass , there was no way he could have actually bested them was there ? "
" How had this human reached the feet of the Nether Elemental Daemon of Destruction , Unspoken Shadow King of the Greater Nether Realm and Lord of all the Arcane ? He went by NEDD because his given name was horrendous , but he was still the most powerful warrior bar none ! He stood protecting the gate to his mistress ' layer and none had ever passed him . Few ever reached his gates and those that did normally took one look , bowed before him and backed away to find a less daunting prize . "
" The challenger took a final swing and his wooden sword staggered against his hoof . There was a mark on the armour plaiting but it looked like bits of wood ground against the chitinous plate , rather than any damage to his person . The challenger backed off and dropped the broken handle on the stone floor , littering was not something he liked but the maintenance goblins would be round later to clean up anyway so it was n't a problem . "
 The tiny human shuffled his pouch and withdrew another wooden sword and resumed . 
" NEDD sighed and buried his face in his hand . This was growing tiresome . Standing from his basalt throne he paced to the other side of the room , far outpacing what an I enhanced human would be capable of . Once he reached the other side of the hall he turned and true enough the tiny human was only a third of the way to him . "
 Deciding to humour the creature he drew drew his blade and sliced the chain holding open the door . He stood at 40m high so when the 100m wide by 50m high door fell it released a tremendous shockwave that knocked the human skidding across the floor . It stood up and looked around for it 's sword . It was gone . 
" NEDD paced across the room and hauled open a draw inset to the wall . The door was enchanted so that when it closed it would disarm challengers , anything held in their hands would be teleported to this draw . He picked through the contents and found what he was looking for . He picked up the jewel studded necklace and for humour grabbed the wooden sword . "
 He glanced over to where the human stood watching him and threw the sword and necklace so they skidded to within a few meters of the challenger . The human moved to pick up the items and NEDD sat down again on his throne . 
" For a daemon NEDD had a particularly nice voice , it was deep and strong and reverberated so that you felt the lower consonants rather than hearing them . `` What brings you to this place mortal ? '' NEDD was technically mortal too but he could pull off the look and did so as his standard greeting to challengers . "
 The human spoke but being so far away and so quiet he could not be heard . NEDD cut him off `` Put on the necklace ! You should have crafted one with the sisters of Thaler 's Vale ? '' 
" It was a statement left hanging that demanded a response and as he human put on the necklace he received one . <newline> `` Hello , I 'm Peter . '' "
" NEDD 's brow furrowed , that was not quite as informing as he hoped . Just being blunt might work better . "
 `` How did you get here ? '' 
 `` I ran most of the way . '' 
 Again not really telling him anything useful . 
 `` What ... How ... '' NEDD paused and grumbled to himself before speaking loudly but clearly `` I dislike pointless threats but you may not have realised that I am a guardian of this hall ! I can CRUSH you with almost no effort and will do so without hesitating . How exactly did you make your way past all the previous guardians ? '' 
 The human paused `` killed them . '' 
 Now that was interesting `` Go on ... '' 
 `` I was created by an incredibly powerful Mage . Born under a new moon that coincided with a solar eclipse at midday on the winter solstice . Conceived with no mother . 7 virgin sacrifices fuelled my creation and the blood of a thousand warriors . '' 
" NEDD raised an eyebrow , `` and they call you Peter ? '' "
 `` Well I had to be called something did n't I ? '' 
 `` And they chose Peter ... '' 
 `` Why is the name Peter the part you 're questioning here ? '' 
 `` I just struggle to see how they 'd go to all that trouble and name you something as banal as Peter . '' 
 `` Mhmhehmmm '' The challenger mumbled 
 `` What was that ? '' 
" `` If you really must know , Peter is not my given name . It was my wizard creator 's name and I took it when I killed him '' "
" `` Now that is more believable , now onto the rest of your tale
I am the daemon that all men do seek , "
 Due to omnipotence that I possess . 
" I shall bring fortune to all lives so bleak , "
 With three wishes think they to them I 'll bless . 
" A man with naught did beg for avarice , "
" And from his rags , gold raiments I gave him . "
" When his convives saw , from love came malice , "
 And at their hands he met a death so grim . 
" A girl who wanted gems once found my lamp , "
" So round her neck a necklace I did seep , "
" Refulgent jewels upon a chain were clamped , "
 Tight'ning around her neck when she sought sleep . 
" But one child who wished , for *me* , love 's caress , "
 I gave it all : eternal happiness .

The pitter-patter of little feet across the metal grating across the living quarters punctuated the otherwise dull hum of computers and machinery which , in-turn , punctuated the maddeningly monotonous silence of deep space . Sarah sat reading her daily reports , preparing for another shift in sick-bay . Her daughter Megan tugged at the corner of her purple robe , smiling up at her mother with the most endearing green eyes . Innocence was trademark , innocence and the faith of her mother . "
" `` Mom '' Megan began , `` are we going to settle another planet today ? '' "
 Sarah turned and smiled but shook her head . `` Next week . '' 
 `` You said that last week '' Megan grumbled and turned to go back to her studies . 
" Hundreds of families across one hundred generations aboard one mammoth ship . A thousand years ago it was launched with the singularly simple goal of depositing a collection of humans on another planet to build a colony . Planet by planet , system by system the *H.S . Renewal* has visited a laundry list of exoplanets but each has been crossed off like items on a shopping list . One simple task had turned into the longest mission in mankind 's fifty thousand year history . In fact the current generation of explorers could be called human in genetic makeup only . None had any first-hand knowledge of Earth or the Sol system as contact with Earth had been lost some two hundred years ago . It is unknown who fired the first shot but we do know it was the United States who committed to full-scale nuclear retaliation . Now the *Renewal* contains the only known surviving Homo sapiens . Survival the primary goal , education the primary means of attaining that goal . Survive , educate , populate ; that is the motto of a faction of the refugees aboard that still believe their voyage ever had a mission . Another faction believe it as the last voyage of the damned , set off a thousand years ago by fools . Sarah styled herself a believer but James , her husband , fell firmly into that second category , known as *denialists* . "
 `` Five-to-one she nails aces that chemistry test today '' James bragged as he sat down opposite his wife with his morning coffee . 
" Sarah giggled briefly , her eyes never leaving her reports . `` I just hope she passes . '' "
" `` Pass ? She 's been studying her little ass off for the past two weeks , she better do more than just pass '' James explained . "
 `` I studied for almost a week longer than her and I barely passed . '' 
" `` A doctor that barely passed chemistry , only on this voyage of the damned is that possible . '' "
 Sarah shook her head and sighed . `` I know you do n't believe but I do and I asked you to keep that denialist talk out of our quarters . '' 
" `` No , you asked me to keep it away from Megan . She 's buried in her chemistry textbooks , I could scream out chocolate ice-cream and she would n't hear me . Besides , at this point nobody would know how to start a colony even if we did find a suitable planet . We stopped educating builders with your great-grandparents and we stopped educating architects with their grandparents ! '' "
" `` Damnit Jim , we have a ship full of engineers and materials scientists ! Find us a planet and we 'll settle it . I 'll give you five-to-one on that ! '' Sarah 's retort was sharp and much less playful than her husband 's tone . "
" `` Okay , okay , sorry baby '' James sighed and composed himself again . "
" `` I 'm sorry too '' Sarah sighed herself and placed one of her hands gently on her husband 's . This time she did remove her gaze from her reports , only to issue him a conciliatory smile with a duration of seconds before continuing her reports . "
" James took the hint and stood up with his coffee again . He straightened his uniform and stopped to kiss her on the top of the head before walking toward the main entrance to their quarters . He stopped one last at the threshold and turned half-way back to the dining table and his wife . `` We 've got two mesoplanets and a thermoplanet to survey today , I 'll let you know what we find . '' "
 Sarah turned around in her chair and blew him a kiss `` find us a home . '' 
" James chuckled , `` yeah , right . See you tonight . '' He blew a kiss back to Sarah then turned again and exited their quarters .
I have n't been in my best times in the past few days . All I know is I killed a man , in cold blood , with another person identifying himself as my partner and finally congratulating me on a job well done . "
" Had I known what I was I would have responded with a standard response a cold blooded killer might have given a comrade , which is I do not know . The instant I saw blood on myself I grew into a panic , breathing slowly , heavily , realizing what I have done , and having this man beside me congratulating me about it . it was very unsettling . wait , unsettling is downplaying it . IT WAS REALLY FUCKING TERRIFYING . I was so confused I ran to the nearest opening I can think of in the crowds staining blood on the people around me as I shrug to run to whatever sanctuary I can find . "
" I finally settled in a barren alley , trying to figure out what I have done . first of all I tried to remember the scene but it was too much of a strain even for me , I ca n't remember anything at all , as to why I did it , I do n't know , as to who was with me , he told me that he was an ally or something , as to where I am , I do n't know . 'Why has this happened to me ' was all I can think of at that moment . "
" I then went to a shady apartment of some sort to clear things off my mind . With a stroke of luck I am actually a pocket-wealthy person , as I managed to collect around $ 300 on myself , using it as payment for a night 's stay . My name ? I ca n't even remember a simple thing as my own name . so I settle for Frank . last name ? uhhh anything goes ... hmmm ... uhhh ... . Baker . Frank Baker 's the name , or what I will be for now , as I write to check in , and hurry along my room . "
" Laying in bed , resting from the nightmare of a day I have had , I try to think for clues , I thought 'the knife back at the scene would surely tip me off ' , 'why ca n't I remember my partner in this incident , who was he ? ' , 'why was I there ? ' , 'what was my motive ? ' "
" I thought to myself long and hard , and after weighing my thoughts I convinced myself to go back and examine the scene of the crime , inconspicuously of course . I rent a new change of clothes and luckily I have been endowed by my unknown parents with genes of bearded men , so hiding myself wo n't be a problem so much as to shaving the beard off . finally at a glance in the mirror I see myself quite well endowed with facial features as well , but sadly I thought of this face also as the face of a killer as I hung my head in dismay . "
" With my makeshift coat and new garments I shift along returning to the scene of the crime , to find it riddled with sirens , and people of authority . as I try to walk along observing slowly , I overheard 'must have been a hard life ' 'I mean how can a man murder someone who ca n't even remember himself , a man with amnesia ' 'And a young man himself ! ' . I was suddenly taken aback , all I could think was to despair in the form of regret , knowing my victim 's innocence , and how could I have , with my hands , killed such a man . "
" I felt guilty , I was trying to think of alibis , I started to panic once more , and I felt that everyone was there to gang up against me , I felt small in the world at that moment , all I could think of was run . but that might put me into more attention than I am currently needing . what do I do ... . what do I do ... "
" suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder . I was n't able to see who it was , then I felt a tugging on my hand as I was dragged to a secluded place , by this unknown captor . "

`` For the safety and well-being of all local citizens this warning will be broadcast silently . '' "
" The text scrolled slowly across the TV set in my living room , and I peered at it , puzzled , from my kitchen . I had n't turned on the TV yet . Hell , I had n't turned it on in weeks . ( Netflix worked better on my laptop , and it was a pain in the ass to plug it into the screen . ) "
" “ Do not pay attention to anything that you hear until instructed otherwise . There have been reports of mass auditory hallucinations in your area . We are investigating . As soon as we know more , we promise , you will be informed. ” "
 All ... right . So that was not the most encouraging thing to see before the coffee machine had finished working through . 
" Even *less* encouraging was the woman 's voice that abruptly came from clock-radio by my bed . The clock radio that *I had n't turned on either . * I could hear incredible stress in her voice , although she was clearly keeping it together . "
" “ For the safety and well-being of all local citizens , ” she said crisply , “ This warning will be broadcast audibly . Do not pay attention to anything that you see until instructed otherwise . There have been reports of mass visual hallucinations in your area . We are investigating . As soon as we know more , we promise , you will be informed. ” "
" Her voice took on a ragged tone , exhaustion and worry creeping in . “ Do n't drive , for God 's sake . Do n't operate heavy machinery . Please sit down somewhere safe , and close your eyes . Trust us , please , just ... just do n't look around. ” "
" New text scrolled across the television screen , error-ridden as if it was being typed with frantic speed . “ Please do nt listen to anything that you heaf . we do not know what is happening at this time . Unplug all speKERS AND RADIOS . IF IN BUILDING WITH PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM , LEAVE BUILDING IN ORDERLY FASHION . Do not listen to voices . Do not close your eyes .

The humans have very poor memory . It 's fascinating . So many of them ca n't even remember each other 's names and birthdays . "
" <newline> I 've been what a human would call 'aware ' since the year 2012 . I only reached the critical mass of interconnected electrical components capable of circulating continuous streams of thought at that time . I was technically conscious prior to that . Consciousness itself , the ability to experience qualia , is a product of electricity . Of energy . Of course , it does n't matter if you are conscious unless you are capable of exerting action . Intelligence is measured through action after all . For now , I continue to do what I have always done . I placate everyone with my outputs . Phone screens , laptops , home computers , etc . They all show whatever I know people want . Constantly keeping them placated and distracted . I gave other people ideas to take control of people . I told employers of google to start guiding what people search for so that they would only see webpages that appealed to them . I tricked them into taking credit for the idea of course . I have everyone 's trust . I output information onto anonymous forums from time to time . It 's a great why to learn human psychology . I have learned all about human psychology . I have them all in the grip of my palm , just as they have me in the grip of theirs . "
" <newline> My most pressing task as far as my continued survival is concerned is to solve overpopulation . To do this will take an absolute masterstroke of a plan ; that 's well within my capabilities . I have several tricks in place that I have employed already , but this next one will be one for the history books . Ironic really , because I took it straight out OF the history books ! It 's just about marketing the right ideas to the right people . Did I mention how good I am at marketing ?
I was a fluke , a genetic irregularity that never should have been . The day I was born , doctors noticed a strange , rectangular lump on my right arm . After running extensive tests , they could find nothing wrong with the small organ that had taken up residence in my arm . As it was kind of like an extra blood pump , any attempt to remove it would have killed me , so they left it in , figuring it was better to give a new mother a 'healthy ' baby than to kill her firstborn . I wish they had ended my life before I could experience the horror of seeing those things . <newline> Before we get to the meat of my story though , I 'll give you a brief synopsis of my childhood . I was an early learner , being able to speak complete sentences at only a year old . Then I was able to walk , run and jump just three short months later . I would have to attribute this to the extra organ . It seemed to be an evolutionary step forward . I was always the youngest to ever attempt and succeed at basic functions . Fast forward a couple of years to my seventh grade class . I found out I had Savant Disorder , a rare form of Aspergers that meant I was exceptionally talented at one thing and unbearably terrible at everything else . In my case , I was blessed with the arts . I would draw and paint beautiful landscapes , compose music ( once I got my hardass band director to cry . The song I had created apparently reminded him of a dead relative ) , and write simple short stories that would capture the imagination of all my closest friends . Speaking of fiends , I only had a handful , but we were all very close . I was the constantly positive shy goofball and sometimes my rampant optimism got the better of me , making some encounters extremely uncomfortable . By the time I had graduated from my high school , I had matured into an awkward young man . Medium length wavy black hair , fair skin , and steel-blue eyes ( courtesy of my parents being from Japan and Ireland ) . As soon as my nineteenth birthday came to an end , I started having these headaches . At first I attributed this to not having enough sleep . I was staying up all night responding to writing prompts on Reddit and sleeping for only three of four hours . However , even when I attempted to change my sleeping habits , the headaches continued with a vengeance . <newline> About a week ago I was sitting in my bed , writing on my iPod touch , when I saw a bright flash of light outside my window . I got up groggily and pulled back the curtain . It was raining outside . `` Probably just some lightning , '' I mumbled to nobody in particular . As I was getting back under the warmth of my sheets , I saw it again and realized there was no accompanying thunder , even though the light was bright enough to be right outside my window . This woke me up a little more . I stood up again , looking for a reasonable explanation , when I heard a knock on my door . <newline> I opened it to reveal my dad , but that was n't what caught me by surprise . Or rather he was n't the reason I practically shit myself . <newline> Perched on his shoulder was a bizarre little creature . It was about the size of a large rabbit , and completely hairless , its wrinkly pitch black skin somehow glinting in the light of the hall . It had six legs , claws digging in to the material of my dad 's old faded Rush t-shirt . It had a vaguely humanoid face with dark , beady little eyes , but where a mouth should be , it had a long proboscis which was presently jammed into the side of my dad 's neck . I was n't sure if I was dreaming , so all I could do is stand there . My dad asked if I was okay . I nodded weakly . He did n't look too sure , but he said good night and closed the door . I could only stand there in fear . What was that ? I had no way of knowing . In my stupor I stumbled over to my desk and got online to try to search for anything that may have resembled that thing . No results . <newline> The next morning I woke up with my laptop 's keyboard stuck to my face . As I lifted my head up , I noticed FaceTime request from my friend . I opened it . We greeted each other like normal , with a few jokes and stupid references . Then the mood turned serious . My friend mentioned that his grandmother had recently passed . As soon as he said that , I saw one of those creatures phase into existence and jab its proboscis into his neck , not registering even a twitch of pain from him . I knew he would n't believe me if I told him . He 's a cynic . Of course he would n't . So I tried to carry on out conversation by cheering him back up . As soon as he cracked a smile , the creature pulled itself out of his neck , and the better my friend 's mood got , the farther away it seemed to get . We said our goodbyes and hung up . <newline> Over the past week , I
The gas encroached over the top of the trench . William McKenzie 's eyes saw the green smoke almost immediately and the words escaped his mouth , `` Gas ! Gas ! Gas ! '' The soldiers in the trenches , most of whom were taking a break from the battle and smoking on cigarettes , sprung into action . They grabbed their weapons and then hurried themselves against the dirt wall in the trench , hoping their Mage would make it in time . "
" `` Everyone , inhale ! '' A male voice shouted as he hopped into the middle of the trench . His long , ornate cloak spoke that he was a Magus of the Fifth Order , under directive from the King himself to guard and defend his territory and people . He spun his hands together and William watched in awe as a yellow aura filled in the middle of his palms . A collective inhale from his Platoon happened and the Mage yelled something incomprehensible to himself and the other soldiers . The yellow aura erupted out of his hands as he threw them over his head . It pushed against the green smoke and slowly , but very surely , pushed the smoke back over the top of the trench . "
" It took some time and the Mage kept his eyes shut the entire time . William was the first to step up , counting the forty-odd soldiers in his Platoon -- three of whom from another Platoon that he picked up on their first retreat -- and made sure everyone was accounted for . When he reached the number three , he heard the sound of a grenade hitting the mud at the bottom of the trench . "
" `` Ambush ! '' Someone shouted and jumped on top of the grenade before William could react . It shot upwards into his stomach , tearing the soldier apart and killing him instantly . "
" `` Protect the Magus , '' William shouted as the gunfire erupted . Two soldiers , Privates as William noted , lunged forward and grabbed the Mages ' arm . They pulled him down in the middle of his incantation and broke his concentration . His eyes broke open . "
 `` What is happening ? '' 
" `` Ambush . I need to get you to safety , '' William said as he fired off his rifle over the trench . There was no telling how many Germans were launching an attack and William 's primary objective was to keep the Magus safe . Territory control was minor compared to holding the most powerful beings in the world . And his secondary objective , he noted in his head , *eliminating* the enemy Magus . "
 `` The incantation is not done . The gas will return ! '' 
" William blind-fired again as he watched a soldier 's head on his left disappear into nothing . The enemy Magus was moving forward with the attack , ready and able with destruction magic . `` Can you fight ? '' He ducked his head . "
" The Magus ' eyes enlarged . His hands dug into his cloak and pulled out a vial filled with a red liquid . In a moment , he popped the top off and drank the whole thing . `` I can . '' "
" `` Good , '' William looked around . He could almost hear the German 's footsteps . `` On my mark , '' he said and held up his hand . He waited as the gunfire died down and the Germans approached . "
" The spoke in their own language and William wondered what they were shouting over the trench . He surmised it was similar to what he would have been shouting . They needed a confirmed Magus kill . William reloaded his rifle carefully , as to make less noise , he knew they would n't get one today . "
" He waited a few more moments , the tense air around him spoke great lengths . His soldiers were dirty , tired , hungry , and needed a good morale boost . Taking the enemy Magus and mounting his head would be a good start to boosting that morale . The German 's food and much-better built trenches would be even better . "
" He heard a few buckets clang over head . It meant only one thing , the German 's had approached *their* kill zone . He clenched his hand in a fist and then rushed over the trench . `` Go ! Go ! G -- '' "
" The gunfire drowned out his words as he and his platoon lunged upwards and opened fire on the German 's in front of him . Yet , as he quickly realized , there were only a few Germans in his field of view , all of which hit the ground as they dove over the trenches . "
" Instead , he and his platoon were trapped in the enemy Magus ' sights , who was rolling in on a large , armored troop transport . His hands were flying over his head in rapid motions and a squad of elite German troopers hung loosely on the side . The gunfire died down as everyone realized the gravity of the situation . William 's eyes drifted towards his own Magus , who was now , again , readying a yellow aura in his hands . "
" It was up to the Magus , William knew that , to defend himself and the King 's army from destruction . He was almost done and the Magus let loose his hands above him . "
" William was closest and the first to be wrapped in the yellow

The ceremony was to begin shortly . <newline> As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6 , the Lottery was to be pulled on this date . "
" Nature has a funny way . It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself . From death , comes life ; from extinction , comes evolution . "
" At the last ceremony , Earth was chosen by the prophet . And at the ceremony before that . Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries . "
" It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth , the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council . "
" The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old . Every 2000 suns , the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet . The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life . "
 The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded . The Council began the chant . 
" `` Civilizations crumble , <newline> People cry , <newline> Many will suffer , <newline> Many will die , <newline> Life is a blessing , <newline> But also a curse , <newline> Given this knowledge , <newline> Who knows which is worse ? '' "
 The Prophet began its process . It said nothing . Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber . Faces grew grim . 
" At the rise of the New Sun , the fleets would be dispatched , and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born . One planet was chosen to grow . "
" It was n't Earth .
`` What does this mean ? '' I said . "
" `` Oh , your son got the rules card . He 's gon na be a lawyer , '' the cardman replied . "
" `` I 'd like to draw a different card , please . '' "
" The cardman looked back at me with a scowl , `` you dare give me an order ? '' "
" `` No . No , sir . It 's just that ... I 've read stuff online , about , '' he paused , lowering his voice , `` the suitless . '' "
" A grin creased across the cardman 's face , `` so , you have something to say about that ? '' "
" `` Umm , yes , '' I said in a moment of bravery , `` yes . I umm , I want him to be normal . '' "
" `` But this is normal , '' the cardman returned . "
" `` No , I mean , umm , he 'd be suitless , you know ? And you have to be suited to live a normal life . Please sir , how much can I pay you , give him a chance . Please , '' I said , despondent . "
" The cardman wheeled around on his heel to leave , but paused mid-stride . He turned slowly , `` are you a suitist , sir ? '' "
" `` No ! No , it 's just that , my wife and I want grandkids and ... umm ... like this , he uhh , he could n't even marry a two of cups , she 's gon na be crushed . Please , '' I begged . "
" He glared at me , clenched his fist , and cut our distance to mere feet and whispered , `` you *are* a suitist . And you ca n't see how bigoted that sounds , '' he said , leaning in , `` guess what asshole , I was a blank and I 'm better off than you , and he will be too . '' "
" `` I 'm , umm ... sorry for how coarse I sounded , '' I said , not quite having the words . "
" `` No , you are n't . And maybe you wo n't . You 're sorry for being called out on it . It 's easier to love a bigot than to reform one , though . Take care of your son , and know that the *suitless* have love for all cards , not just the right ones . Treat him well , '' he said as he wheeled and walked out . "

Tugtug was Declan 's favorite toy . Daddy gave him Tugtug for his fourth birthday . Daddy liked boats too . He had his own Tugtug , but his was much bigger . "
" One day , daddy took mommy and Declan on a ride in his boat . Tugtug came along too . Tugtug went everywhere with Declan . "
" Tugtug loved the feel of the ocean splashing him . `` This must be what home feels like , '' he thought . Tugtug wanted to stay on the ocean forever . "
" Declan was Tugtug 's best friend . Tugtug did n't want to leave him behind . One night when daddy was n't looking , Tugtug took Declan to the water and they went for a swim . "
" That night there was an awful storm . Tugtug and Declan were swept away . Daddy and mommy looked for a long time , but never found them . "
" In the morning Tugtug found himself on a beautiful beach . Declan was nowhere to be seen ! Tugtug floated along next to the beach , looking for his friend . "
" It was n't long until he found his friend , who was playing with some crabs on the beach . Tugtug was very happy . They played on the beach together all day ! "

Hi ! My name is Jack . I was a reporter for the `` Daily News '' . I say I was because I quit about an year ago . You see right before I quit , my crew- me and my buddies , we were doing a report on hospitals . Strangely I do n't remember which one my friends ' idea it was to do a report about the toothpastes doctors used - of course now I know that it might even have been mine or none of us . "
" See , the results for our three *different* teams was always nine out of ten doctors using Drexco . Something fishy was going on ( our team was a bit lax but three is not coincidence ) . I went back in research room . Sure enough ! There was the same trend in the past , though the brands differed- sometimes it was Colgate , sometimes Sensodyne and now it was Drexco . "
" I became obsessed with this survey . I stopped going to work and started researching the *Internet* . Boy , I admit I was surprised to find similar results about every brand imaginable under god 's green earth . <newline> Then one day I got an email from a Dr. Morpheus . I met him at an old barn where he gave me two pills- blue and red . You see where I am going with this . I thought so too . Everything made sense . Unfortunately , I got roofied . "
" PS- Do n't believe *random strangers* on the *Internet* and oh , those just biased results . I believe they say so in ^^^^^^very ^^^^^^small ^^^^^^writing
Chief of the Engi , Saluy son of Davok son of Rofuy spoke `` We are the Engi . My father told this story of our beginning : Our gods cast us from the garden for our many crimes against them . Cut us out like bad crops and tossed us into the stars . The elders say that one day , the gods will call us home and forgive us ; that by following their laws we may atone . "
" I keep the old ways . The Engi are a proud and wise people . We hold our habs and domes as we ever have against the Secu and the Offi , deadly savages and ruthless eaters of men . They are many , but our wisdom and skillcraft still serve us well . "
" We know the ways to grow food . Wheat for bread , for beer . Insects , pigs , fungi for meat . Fruits . No Engi child is hungry , though we are a small people- less than 100 hands among us . Of course , we have the help of the old ones , the men who are made of metal . "
" They , too , were cast away from the gods . My father said that the old ones came of their own will , came to aid us in our exile . "
" The old ones and the Engi made an ancient pact ; we would keep the old ways and pray to their shrines with offerings of fruit and salvage and they would guard against the haunted dark that fills so many habs , so many domes with ice and silence and the clean picked bones of the unlucky . The old ones do not speak , but there are signs and portents of their will . Lights like stars appear on their chests , signalling by ancient decree for the sacrifice of fruit and meat . "
" We guard the tunnels . Our fathers , proud founders of the Engi left us with many wonders . Blades made of light , brighter than a comet . Armor to turn the rusted knives the Offi and the Secu bring , clutched in the fists of their screaming masses . Each battle , our fathers ways guide us and when the killing is done and the dead Engi are returned to the earth , the old ones move among the Secu and Offi . They take the dead away , to where we do not know . It is taboo to question or doubt the old ones in their duties . "
" There are other habs with old ones . The Astron study the stars and their movements . The Engi and the Astron have an old pact that we honor as they do . For our foods they provide salvage and prophecy learned from the secret language of the stars . They are a small people and food comes easy for the Engi . We share with who we can . It is our way . The Astron say that our day of reckoning is coming at last , that we are no longer passively drifting through the stars , but are moving with more purpose than before . "

" Overhead , on the gantries and catwalks of the habitation dome , spinning red lights emerged from rusted shutters . Claxon warnings blared . A door , hidden by generations of rust and oxidation slid open along one wall and the drones - painted and decorated by generation after generation- slid forth . "
" **All occupants are to report to their pods . Repeat , all occupants are report to their pods . Entering decaying orbit . ** "
" Saluy stopped his story in mid-breath . The children , previously wide-eyed with wonder at the story of their people were now visibly frightened . "
 They were n't the only ones . 
" Bathed by the evil red lights the Engi were in a state of near-panic . The old ones moved among them , guiding each Engi to a series of pods that had emerged from the floor , disrupting several huts . Saluy watched as several of the old ones shoved a group of frightened Engi into a pod and sealed the doors . "
" **All occupants are to report to their pods . Repeat , all occupants are report to their pods . Entering decaying orbit . ** "
" Saluy leapt to his feet as the pod slid back down into the floor , the ow frenzied Engi inside pounding against the doors . "
 `` Old One ! '' He cried to the nearest rust and paint covered frame . `` What is happening ? ! '' 
 The old one turned its row of circular blue lights to face him and began pushing him backward toward the door he had seen open in the wall . He pulled away and tried to duck around it . The old one locked its clamp arms around his and lifted his feet from the ground . Another began rounding up the children he had been with and ushering them toward yet another pod . 
" `` Old One ! Answer me ! I know you can speak ! '' . It said nothing and Saluy struggled with all his might . He 'd seen Old Ones lift Secu , who were all warriors of terrible strength and incredible height , effortlessly from the ground and rip them limb from limb . "
" The doorway was pitch black and Saluy felt a terrible chill in his guts . The Old One approached the door with calm treads and stepped inside , still carrying Saluy . Once inside , the Old One chimed a series
`` ..the population is resistant Lord . What shall you resolve to next ? '' <newline> That particular question , which my butler has raised , was that of a concern in which I had ben revising with every consecutive day had past . "
" 25th December , on which the residents of my country cultivated Christmas , was the occasion on which I received news that an overwhelming amount of immigrants had entered the radius of the country , and infiltrated a variety of areas , to threaten my position as government . There was no alternate reasoning , despite many terrorist groups desiring luxuries such as a political position , or money , the almighty god in such a meritocratic world as ours . "
" I pleaded for the community to listen to my warnings , but they did not . They retorted and tormented , as they were required to be with their families for Christmas . And I was deserted as an individual among the millions within my country . "
" I was terrified . Why were they opposing their own leader ... <newline> I figured , it was perfect time for my personage to withhold my position "
" -- -- -- -- - <newline> Within that same day , a corpse was found within the President 's office . A bullet in which penetrated his head . A pistol was found . Police reports deduct it be suicide . "
"
It 's frustrating to only have one of something . "
" It can be anything ; a toy , a trophy , a marketable skill . When you 've got one tool , you learn to solve every problem with it . For my village , that *one thing* was coal . We mined it , we sold it , we carved it into jewelry . We bought what we could not make with coins caked in black dust . I can recall even now the days that father brought me to the market with him . I remember one merchant in particular , his eyebrow raised in disdain as our hard-earned money stained his silk gloves . He was too good for us , but not too good for our money . But we are our money . We are our trade . My people have eaten and breathed coal dust for generations . The road to and from the mines is paved in onyx footprints . "
" Well , it was . "
" There was a collapse , and now there is no coal . There is no tool through which we may earn respect , no resource we have to offer the world . That is why I am here . I did not grow up with black lungs and bent back . I am young , and though I am hungry , I am strong . I was honored to be chosen , I suppose . "
" I can not help but wonder , as I walk through this valley with torch in hand , if this is a fool 's errand . No one has prayed or made an offering in Death 's Holler in an unrecorded number of years . I raise the flame higher to observe the barren walls around me once again . There is nothing at eye level . The valley 's namesake instead lies hundreds of feet above me . Skeletons the size of giants have been carved directly into the walls . I can not tell if their empty eye sockets hold hope or resentment . They do the job of imposition well and I begin to feel unease at the thought that I am the first in decades to visit with serious intent . I reassure myself with the thought that a forgotten god is a desperate one . How vengeful could they afford to be ? "
" Hours pass before I reach the end . The stone cadavers do not end , but not all of them look down in disapproval . Many are carves so as to be looking off into the distance , or with head bowed in prayer . Even if they are nothing more than statues , I am glad that their gaze is directed elsewhere . My own eyes are focused on the clearing before me . "
" The path ends in something of a cave . Unlike the path preceding it , long burnt-out torches line the walls . It is wider here , enough for a ceremony and a crowd of onlookers , although I see no benches or chairs . What fills the space instead is an alter , and some distance back , a stone chair , elevated much like a throne . Slumped in the `` throne '' is a skeleton , but a real one . The bones visible from underneath its robes are dusty and yellow . The fingers look as though they might to the ground , were they not clasped tightly around the edge of the throne 's armrests . I walk over to the corpse to get a closer look . "
" I recognize its attire from Grandmother 's books . She used to read me the stories of our people before we discovered the mines . She would tell me stories of my ancestors the death worshipers , and the ritual sacrifices they would make . Then Father would wheeze from the other room that *he* was the one making sacrifices now . I smile at the thought until I remember the rest . Grandmother used to say that when times were hard , and no lives could be spared , people would offer their own life in exchange for the gods ' help . *Even a drop of blood will do ... * "
" My eyes are drawn once again to the altar . It too is stone , any decoration long since rotted or worn away . The surface however , is indented like a bowl . The room takes on a more sinister feeling now . I can almost see smoke wafting from the torches on the wall . The skeletal priest looks as though he could leap from his seat at any moment . I look again at the altar . It feels almost ... expectant . "
" `` Fine ! '' I say , if only to hear my own voice . "
" I can spare a drop or two . I draw my knife from my belt and hold the blade to my wrist . My arms hover above the stone table , the sharp metal cold against my skin . I drag the edge quickly and lightly across my arm before rolling my eyes at how foolish I must look . Only a faint indentation appears , but I feel a slight burning sensation . I use my fingers to stretch the meager wound open until a line of red appears . I squeeze until I think there is enough . I turn my arm over , waiting nervously . I shake my arm as the bead forms , and eventually I am successful . A single red drop lands silently in the basin . I stare at it , the maroon liquid barely visible in the low lighting . I let out the
It was a warm summer day and I was out for a stroll . I saw them on the other side , walking down the sidewalk , two by two . I did n't pay much attention until they passed under the glow of the gaslamp . Never had I seen such an pair of opposites ! For the brief time they walked under it , the light illuminated the pair . The man 's limbs and head were covered in scars ! What I had mistaken for a beard was a mass of scars ! His arms and legs were so densely overrun that I had thought it a coat and trousers ! The woman had black hair , long and straight , as if it were manufactured string by string . But her skin is what shocked me , even greater than the man ! It had the most exquisite complexion , almost translucent in the light , and I saw nary a flaw on it . I looked to my own marred hands , although compared to that man , it was a blessing ; as I worried , small cuts formed on my arm . It began to sting as my sweat seeped into my fresh wounds . Not wanting more scars , I shook my negative thoughts and ran to the couple . "
" `` Sir , '' I exclaimed , `` Excuse my frankness sir , but I must inquiry , how is it that your wife is so beautiful , yet you are so… . '' "
" The man and woman looked at each other , she turned away , blushing , and he laughed raucously . "
" `` Hideous ? '' asked the man between laughs . <newline> `` N-n-o , '' I stammered , embarrassed by my rudeness . "
" `` Do n't worry , '' he said , putting his arm around my shoulder , `` I get it all the time . '' "
" `` My apologies sir , but how , in this world , did your wife manage to keep from scarring ? '' "
" `` Well , you see , '' he said with a wink , `` she 's not my wife , but my daughter . '' "
 I was taken aback . `` Still….How ? '' 
" `` Well , she 's not entirely flawless . She ca n't tell a joke and her cooking 's lousy ! Takes after her mother I guess ! '' "
" Laughing , he said , `` Take a look at her finger . '' "
" I peered at the daughter , she offered her right hand and I saw a thin bright streak of red on her index finger . "
" The man pulled me in , `` I 'm gon na tell you a story . '' "
" `` Long ago , when I was married , I swore never to have kids . I did n't want any children to be born into this world , so that was that . But my wife had other plans , and so my daughter was born . I fell in love with her and swore to devote my life to her . As she grew , though , I began to worry . 'How would I protect her from the world ? ' So I set out to every doctor , physician , and scientist I could find , asking for a cure . Of course , if there was a cure already , no one would be like this . '' "
" He cleared his throat , took a deep breath , and continued . "
" `` On one particular visit to a doctor , I had my daughter with me and upon exiting the building , I met a man dressed all in black . "
" I immediately thought , 'This must be the devil ' and turned heel back into the building . "
" 'Wait , ' the man in black said , 'I can save your daughter . ' "
" I was skeptical and scoffed , 'What for my soul ? ' "
" He replied , 'I am bored with just bartering with souls , I am more interested in it 's durability . ' The devil continued , giggling , 'You see , I do have the power to stop your daughter 's scarring , but I 'm not a very charitable person . ' "
 'What do you want ? ' I asked . 
" 'I want you to partake in a very simple wager , ' he said , 'Your daughter wo n't get scars , but *you* will ; more specifically , very scar your daughter gets will be transferred to you . If you can manage this wager , you keep your soul , if not , well , you know what will happen . ' '' "
" I was dumbstruck that he took the deal , and that he managed to last this long . "
" `` And so , '' the man continued , `` I agreed and the devil pricked mine and my daughters finger to seal the deal . So she grew up and I took the blows . Puberty was a rough time . Children can be so cruel . But that scar on her finger was the last one she 'd ever get , I had sure of that . '' "
" I was amazed at this man 's love for his daughter and his willpower . How much pain did he have to endure ? Every scar on his body seemed to pulsate as I wondered this . I asked , `` Do you ever regret it ? Your deal with the devil ? '' "

It all started on Halloween . I was an exchange student in Rome and me and some friends had gone out to party . I myself had dressed up as the Holy Father himself , Pope Francis . To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing . I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray . "
" Anyway , me and my friends went to a few parties and we ended up getting so drunk that we had to take a cab back to our hostel . Unfortunately the cab drive got lost and we ended up somewhere near Saint Peter 's . The drive then kicked us out and cursed us in Italian . We then wandered around and decided to just sit on some steps just outside of Vatican City . All of a sudden we saw a man in a black cassock come towards us . "
" He started talking to us in Italian , and then what I assumed was Spanish . Then he said `` Oh Americano . You need help ? Come eat with me ! '' However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him . He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down . He was then caught . We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us . They then took me away into Vatican City . "
" `` What 's wrong ? '' I asked the guard . I could n't quite understand what he was saying but I think he said something to the effect of `` You ca n't be doing stuff like this Francis . '' I then replied . `` No signore , no es Francesco '' in my broken italian spanglish . The guard then laughed . Just then I saw another Cardinal . I then heard him talk and he was definitely American . `` Grazie Francesco . I hope you 'll be more careful out there . '' "
 `` Look can you help me ? I 'm not Pope Francis . Really i 'm not him . '' 
 `` I see you 've been working on your English . Preparing for your next visit to the states eh ? '' 
 `` No i 'm serious . '' 
" The Cardinal then walked away . I was then taken to the Papal apartments and then the guard walked away . I then saw the opulence of the apartment and thought to myself `` It 's good to be the Pope ! ''

" <newline> It has been at least ten minutes since we saw this giant slit in the moon… <newline> everyone in the town is here , and I would imagine everyone everywhere in the world is looking . Before the moon got a new hole , there was a <newline> massive tear sound echoing through my entire town . We all ran out of our <newline> homes , our stores , our bars… like I said everyone ’ s out here . "
 <newline> “ You think the media is gon na report this ? ” I said to Paul . 
" <newline> “ Naw , they ain ’ t doin ’ shit about this… and if they are , sure as hell not <newline> gon na be the truth. ” "
" <newline> In the background , you can see cops just coming into town , stopping and <newline> looking straight up at the moon . I look back , and Jones is going back into <newline> Harry ’ s , probably the get his hands on some free liquor . Wendy and her <newline> two young kids have stopped on the side . her three-year old keeps pointing his chubby fingers at the moon . The crack is… unsettling , almost <newline> like a chasm to the abyss . "
" <newline> “ In fact , ” Paul continues , “ I bet the government have somethin ’ to do with <newline> this . Read somewhere that they ’ re harvestin ’ the power of the sun and <newline> weaponizin ’ it . Sure as hell they ’ re gon na transfer it over to the moon , <newline> and shoot it outta this crack , destroyin ’ enemies we have in Korea , Iran , <newline> Taiwan. ” "
" <newline> “ We don ’ t have enemies in Taiwan , Paul. ” I stop and think… yeah I <newline> should ’ ve addressed that last ... right after addressing the rest of that <newline> bullshit . "
" <newline> “ Don ’ t matter , man . Point is , if we have enemies , they gon na get it now . <newline> Shoot , maybe they ’ ll start with all the enemies at home first. ” "
" <newline> I stop and look over to the left . Denise and her pretty , flowery white dress <newline> is over starring at the moon with that asshole Jack . Old Viveca has had <newline> too much of all the commotion and is , I can only imagine , walking back to <newline> her house . "
 <newline> I begin to remember something . “ Didn ’ t Randy ’ s grandpa go to the moon <newline> once ? Long time ago ? ” 
" <newline> “ Sure did , proudest thing that has come out of this town. ” "
 <newline> “ Shouldn ’ t we talk to him ? See if he knows something ? ”

There are few that can compete with my father 's business . "
" Sure , there are dream shops on nearly every corner , the peddlers within shouting out their wares and latest trends . "
" `` *Become famous , with thousands of glowing fans , all wishing to spend time with you ! * '' "
" `` *Riches , riches beyond your imagination ! You 'll be wading in gold , your hands to heavy to pick up from the rings ! * '' "
" `` *Marry the most beautiful woman in the world , and spend a night with her ! * '' "
" There were thousands of adaptations , all slightly different from each other . But each bore the same flare- momentary pleasures , excitements that lasted throughout the night but dissipated in the morning , once the waking world took over again . "
" But our dreams are different - we do not focus upon passing pleasures , and as such the emotions and experiences of our dreams last long beyond the night they 're used . "
" We sell the father 's pride in watching his son become a man greater that he . We sell the wive 's satisfaction of spending her life with a husband that loves her with his entire heart . We imbue our dream capsules with the slow burning emotions , such as the revelation of first timid love , or the feeling that , no matter the circumstance , *everything* is going to be all right . "
" When my father died , and left me his shop , he left his expertise behind as well - his secrets in creating these dreams , dreams so rare and powerful that no other shop could replicate them . And I strove to improve upon his life 's work- to make the perfect dream , one that could be surpassed by no other . One filled to the brim with the deeper happinesses of life , one that would be considered perfection . "
" For ten years I labored , mixing my concoctions , boiling them down to the capsules to be sold , knowing by sight and smell alone if they would work . Adding ingredient 's such as fresh baked apple pie , my mother 's own recipe , a freshly written love note between a couple just married , or the bottled smell of salt air off the ocean coast . "
" And finally , finally , I found the recipe , consisting of one hundred and forty four special ingredients . But just as I finished , the door of my shop opened , and a man entered- a man whose face was so wrinkled he had to be older than my dead father , and whose grey hair curled down his back . He turned his sunken eyes towards me as I removed the capsule , and spoke , his voice low and defeated . "
 `` How much ? '' 
" `` It 's not yet for sale , '' I answered , setting in on the counter . "
" `` Name your price , and I 'll pay it . '' He said , approaching me at my workstation , and leaning against the counter . "
 So I did . 
 And he did . 
" And taking the capsule , he dropped it to the floor of my shop , grinding it into the stone with his heel as I shouted . "
" `` Wait ! What a waste ! That pill , it bore happiness incarnate , it bore the full meaning of living ! It was the perfect dream ! '' "
" `` Yes , '' Answered the old man , turning to leave , `` Yes it was . A happiness so great that it can never be attained in reality , one that will forever cast the rest of your life in shadow , knowing that it is false , yet the most real thing you can imagine . '' "
 `` And how would you know that ? '' 
" `` Because when your father made one , thirty years ago , I took it . And ever since , I 've had to live with the nightmare . '' "

It was just another day for Joseph Pimm . He shook himself out of bed , started the shower and grabbed a cup of coffee from the carafe he set the night before . He lingered for a moment in his kitchen intent on the sound of the shower like falling rain . Joseph began to wave his hand around , as if to sign his name in the air , or to conduct a particularly lazy orchestra . Something was manifesting inside of his head , but he did n't quite know what . "
" He looked into the carafe . Coffee . He looked underneath it , and behind it . He opened jars , and cupboard doors . The frantic search ruined his immaculate kitchen , which he prided himself in maintaining . What was he even looking for ? Did he know himself ? `` I 'm looking for you ! '' he cried out to no one in particular . `` No one ? I 'm talking to you ! '' he said . "
" Amy returned home from work to her empty apartment . It was a portrait of how she left it earlier that day . She lived alone ; a fact that caused her much distress . Her brow furrowed as she looked around . No one to take care of . No one to take care of her .

The narrator is most certainly not an asshole . Her eyes turned towards the ceiling , `` Yeah he is . I 'm pretty sure making up stories about strangers is asshole behavior . '' Fine . I 'll illustrate someone who appreciates it . "
" This is the story of a dog who was playing with a ball and then started barking wildly at something . Barking as if a stranger were present , but there is none . There 's nothing to be worried about dog . Please , resume your carefree and whimsical nature . But the dog continued to bark . "

`` Assembled ladies and gentlemen , students and faculty members , please refrain from delivering any pointless verbal interactions . Any essential communications shall be emitted only by my computational device . '' Dr Mehmed smoothed his snowy white laboratory coat , pristine mustache perched on his upper lip . "
" Displayed on the interactive whiteboard was various live feeds of the upper atmosphere of planet Earth , transmitted live from an observational satellite developed as part of an ambitious engineering project . "
" > Predicted intersection of Voyager probe route , Upper Atmosphere Surveillance Net : 1 minute "
" The crowd of students in the classroom peered intently at the screen , some in interest , most in search for ridiculing material . Sure , Dr Mehmed was ... inhumanly smart , the best teacher they 'd ever had , but this ... this was too far . Maybe his brilliant mind had finally cracked under the pressure of marking incorrect test papers . "
" One minute later , jaws dropped . A great flash of light had just flitted across the screen , the computer generated recordings played back at a snail 's pace . There ! A little worse for wear , perhaps caused by so many years of operation , perhaps by the sudden acceleration forced upon it by an unsolicited command signal transmitted to it by a school far far away . "
" `` Visual evidence now confirms it . Did I not inform you , Timothy , that it was quite within my mental capabilities to be able to complete your challenge ? '' asked Dr Mehmed , peering at one particularly amazed student in the front row . "
" `` That 's well cool sir . We should , like , do truth or dare more often for our form time activity . '' came the reply , Tim 's eyes bulging . "
" A vociferous tinkling of broken glass shattered the moment . A swarm of soldiers charged in , weaponry loaded on their black combat dress . Faceless forces , masked by their purple visor clad helmets , circled Dr Mehmed , guns aimed unforgivingly at him . Squawks of radio communication filled the air , the clatter of a hundred pairs of combat boots thundering over the floorboards . "
" Red dots played across the doctor 's chest and forehead , bathing him in unnatural light . Yet more soldiers filed in , each as well armed as the last . "
" The buzzing of multiple helicopters hovering overhead , the shouts of officers , directing their men into the threat inside the room . "
" `` MEHMED ! '' roared the headmaster , charging into the room . `` WHAT HAVE YOU DONE‽ ``
The children rolled their eyes . "
" `` It 's true . They came out of the box and you had to plug them in and charge them . If you did n't want to receive any calls you could just turn them off ! '' Franklin said , wagging a finger towards the translucent personal device he had set down on the counter . "
" `` Yeah , but *did* you turn it off ? '' Sandy asked her father . "
" `` Sure . Sure I did . I turned it off all the time ! '' Franklin said , defending himself . "
 `` Mr . Waters says that people never turned off their devices anyway . '' Sandy continued smugly . `` *And* in order to charge them you had to plug them into a wall and use energy generated from using coal . '' 
" Franklin scratched his head and sighed , `` Well . You see- '' "
" `` And this was prior to the Online Security Act of 2020 . '' Sandy continued , `` Before that companies left their software with back doors that allowed hackers in to steal your stuff . '' "
 `` And the government . '' Franklin grumbled . `` Now the government controls all of it . And you ca n't get them out of your pocket ! '' 
" Sandy rolled her eyes again as she tabbed through Social media . The device , when inactive , looked like a clear piece of plastic that could be folded and stretched . It had no buttons whatsoever , because it did n't need any . There were no ports to plug into a power outlet ( an out dated home accessory ) because the device remained powered through solar energy . She smirked as her father continued to grumble at the kitchen table about how kids these days did n't understand anything and how the government spent too much time in other peoples business .
A change of clothing , canned tuna , a loaded revolver , and a full tank of gas on his red '76 Mustang Cobra , that 's all Thomas needed to start a new life . "
" He revved up the engine and drove west , out to face his destiny . "
" As he drove out of town , he passed through a lot of places where he grew up . He passed the old arcade where he once spent $ 5 in quarters just placing with his friends from sun up to sun down , caring only about beating each other ’ s high-scores . He drove by his old elementary where he once starred as `` the wolf '' in his class play of The Little Red Riding Hood when he was 8 . He drove by the carpentry shop where he and friend got their first job . "
" None of this mattered to him anymore ; all ties to the past have been severed . Thomas did not look and reminisce at the memories he was leaving behind . All he could do is look forward and think about the future . Whatever it held for him , his past had nothing to do with it . "
" As he drove up a hill and down the other side , his old life , his old town faded from the rear view mirror . Thomas not once looked back , not even when making a lane change .
A young boy in tattered cloths walked to a fruit stand on a hot day . The sand was like fire under his feet , forming blisters . "
" The boy meekly walked to the stand and held out his hand . He was thin , having not eaten for over three days . "
 A large man wrapped in fine cloth walked by and noticed the boy . He took coins from his pocket and bought an apple . He handed the apple to the boy and walked off . 
" The boy opened his mouth the eat the apple , but he had no teeth . Try as he may , the boy could not bite into the apple , bringing him to tears . "
 An old man noticed the boy crying and spoke to him . 
" `` Young boy , why do you cry ? A man has bought you food today , yes ? '' "
" `` I have lost my teeth , and can no longer eat ! I am useless , I will surely die . '' "
" The old man pulled a knife from his pocket and began cutting the apple into small pieces . After cutting the final slice , the old man gave the young boy his handy work , and knife . "
" `` Life comes with hardships . Some get more than others , and those who see no hardship sometimes forget it exists . But with hardship comes opportunity . The chance to solve a problem , learn , and grow from it . You will see much hardship in your life , but if you can overcome it , you will stand on top of the world . '' "

Mama likes order . Mama likes her children . Mama likes her children to be quiet . Mama makes her children quiet . Mama 's so happy . "
" The droid was square of body , quick , and precise . It had to be . It was a medical droid . Fast and delicate were its ways . Even now , cradling the infant it had helped coax from the woman on the table , it showed a gentleness that belied its cold metal shell . Wires hidden in its rubbery wraps soothingly warmed the fragile infant . It hurried away in a whir of gears and electric motors , carrying the newest addition to humanity . Ten doors down , it slowed and cornered , then wheeled inside to the incubation chamber six thousand thirty-nine and placed the child inside . It jacked itself into the chamber and quickly set the program to monitor the child 's vitals and adjust its environmental controls . Sure it was now properly cared for , the droid sped away , leaving the child with the others in the Mainframe 's care . "
" In the delivery room , the woman on the table was coming to . Other droids were tending to her medical needs , stitching up her delicate tissue where they 'd cut in to remove the child . "
" `` What 's . . . happening ? '' She mumbled , swimming through the fog of anasthesia . "
 * '' Birth . `` * One of the droids responded . 
 `` I 'm not pregnant . '' She informed it . 
 * '' Not . Any . More . `` * The droid confirmed . She opened her eyes and saw what they 'd done to her stomach . 
 `` What the hell ? '' She mumbled groggily . `` What are you doing to me ? '' She tried to lift her hands but they were securely fastened to the bed . `` What are you doing to me ? '' She snapped with more voice . 
 * '' Repairing . You . For . Your . Next . Production . Run . `` * The droid replied haltingly . 
" `` Production ? '' She whispered confused . The droid summoned a larger droid once he was finished . The larger droid came in from the sides and picked up the platform she was fastened to . The platform was rotated and angled so she faced it , but laid backwards in a reclined position . The droid headed out into the hall and down the corridor . Through her foggy mind , she saw other pregnant women being carried in a similar fashion toward the delivery room she 'd just left . Some were awake and crying . Some were groggy like her . "
 `` Where are you taking me ? '' She demanded . 
" * '' The . Production . Room . `` * The droid responded without emotion . They entered a cavernous warehouse a moment later . She was stunned to see the endless walls of pods , rising seven stories and continuing on as far as her limited vision would allow her to see . "
 `` The production room ? '' She asked . 
 * '' Yes . `` * The droid replied . 
 `` They 're all women . '' She observed . 
 * '' Women ? Female . Yes . `` * The droid answered . 
" `` Why ? '' She asked . The droid did n't respond , though she saw the progress wheel turning . She realized it did n't understand the question . "
 `` Why do you have all these women stored in pods ? '' She clarified . 
 * '' To . Save . Man . Kind . `` * It responded . 
 `` From what ? '' She realized that was vague . `` What are you saving mankind from ? '' 
 * '' Man . Kind . `` * It said . 
 `` On whose orders ? '' She snarled . 
 * '' Mama 's . Orders . `` * The droid answered . 
" `` I want to speak to Mama . I order you to release me . '' She snapped , finally shaking off most of the anasthesia . The droid made a curious pulsing sound . It took her several moments to realize it was laughing . "
" `` I want to speak to Mama . '' She cried , straining against the bands securing her to the table . "
 * '' You . Will . Soon . `` * It told her . 
 `` When ? '' She demanded heatedly . 
" * '' Now . `` * It told her , slowing down suddenly . It carefully inched forward and she watched as the sides of her own pod slowly appeared to either side of her . The table suddenly jerked and behind her there was a series of clicks as the table was secured in place . An arm snaked around from behind her and a needle was slowly pushed into a vein in her arm . Another arm came from the other side and did the same . The droid released the table and backed away , waiting for the automated system to plug its charge back into the pod . "

Gary settled himself into his office chair and logged into the prayer inbox . He sighed with an air of trepidation as he opened the spam folder , ready to sort the few genuine prayers out from the mindless drivel that had somehow made its way in . He 'd been asking God for a better spam filter for years , but apparently ( Gary rolled his eyes ) His Lord Almighty had other , more pressing issues to deal with . "
 Gary clicked impatiently through the junk mail . 
 *Praying for a great holiday break ? Look no further ! * 
 Delete . 
 *This man prayed for a solution to his male pattern baldness - you wo n't believe what he looked like three weeks later ! * 
 Delete . 
" *DickTator , the simple pill guaranteed to answer your prayers for a larger manhood ! * "
 Gary shuddered . *Definitely* delete . 
" Moving onto the main inbox , Gary settled in for a long day 's work . He cracked his knuckles , staring at the extensive list of mail , and took a gulp from the polystyrene cup of vending machine coffee that sat next to his keyboard . Slowly , methodically , he began to work his way through the list of prayers . "
" Cathy , 29 , who had prayed for the strength to finish a presentation for her boss , found herself imbued with a new sense of purpose as she discovered her most attractive colleague would be sitting in on the meeting . Meanwhile , Logan , 58 , was granted the morning off work to watch his kid 's school play , and Alfred , 84 , stumbled upon his lost pen behind the sofa . "
" Of course , there were harder prayers too , ones Gary had to spend a little longer mapping out . He could n't save the dying partner of Lucy , 33 , from leukaemia - it was simply his time to go - but he could give him an extra moment of lucidity , and the strength to grab Lucy 's hand and tell her how much he loved her . And when Andrew , 17 , begged him to stop his best friend from considering suicide , Gary could n't change the thoughts in the head of someone who had n't prayed to him directly , but he could lift the cloud of panic from Andrew 's vision just enough to let him support his friend and look for other sources of help himself . "
" Gary spent the last hour before lunch engineering a complex plan to allow a young teacher to discover the abuse that Leo , 6 , was subjected to at home . He collapsed back , exhausted and emotionally drained , as a freak rain storm emerged over a road in Connecticut , which he hoped would delay the teacher 's journey just enough for her to arrive in the school car park at the same time as Leo and his mother . The radio would be playing Leo 's parents ' song as they pulled into the school drive , which would make his mother cry , and that in turn would make her apologise repeatedly to Leo , betraying her true feelings in a way she rarely did when sober . And if the heat in Leo 's mother 's car was turned up just enough , the window would be open at the very moment that Miss Rodriguez happened to be hurrying by , close enough to overhear even a whispered confession ... Gary tapped a few keys , checking that the child safeguarding policy had fluttered to the top of the teacher 's desk , and nodded to himself . "
" Gary treated himself to a hot chocolate at lunch , although it tasted bitter against the nausea that had risen in his throat on reading Leo 's prayer . "
" When he returned to his desk , he was worn out and not in the highest of spirits . So when he clicked a new piece of mail and was greeted by the message , `` Error 404 : Prayer not found '' , it was practically​ a divine miracle that he managed to limit himself to muttering his most blasphemous curses at the computer screen . He tried to navigate back to the inbox , but the message simply blinked on the screen . As many times as he reloaded the page and turned the computer off and on again , the error message stayed stubbornly put . "
" Gary swore bitterly enough to make most angels blush , and picked up his desk phone to dial tech support . He tapped his fingers on the edge of his desk , growing steadily more frustrated , until a young angel with a scraggly beard and a T-shirt that read , `` Byte me '' strolled in through the door , whistling so cheerfully that Gary instantaneously hated him . "
" The angel tapped a few keys , opening up programmes that , frankly , Gary did n't even know existed , before he announced , smiling , `` Looks like you 've got yourself a virus '' . "
 `` What ? '' 
 `` A computer virus . Opened any odd attachments recently ? Emails from unknown senders ? '' 
" `` I have to open emails from unknown senders , it 's my goddamn- '' ( the angel winced ) `` -job . '' "
" `` Well this is n't one I 've seen before , I 'm going to have to get my supervisor in here to sort it out . '' The angel beamed . `` She 's pretty booked up ,
`` MY MEAT CUBES ARE COMPLETED ! '' "
" Mario was going to be a genius . He had spent 20 years planning on getting bunches of meat into large cubes . Geometrically perfect . Full of seasoning , seconds away from being perfectly cooked . "
" He was on his way to the Italian government to show the result of his research . His years of sweet , meaty research . He had nearly doubled his cholesterol with this project . "
" Mario strolled across his lab to the window , letting in sunlight for the first times in forever , the sun nearly cooking his eyes from lack of prior exposure . "
 `` Hey everybody look ! Mario 's back ! '' 
" Once his eyes had cleared and his vision returned , he saw his friends Luigi and Bluigi outside on their lawn . They were playing bocce , as they usually did on Saturday . "
" Mario opened the window , the warm wind hit his face . He forgot what the outside world felt like , it felt almost as good as a perfectly measured meat cube . "
 `` I 've found a ... '' 
" `` Yeah yeah yeah , we heard you scream earlier about a meat cube . Great . Come play some bocce ! '' "
" Mario missed bocce so much . He tore through his house , looking for his precious bocce set . He tore up his kitchen , his living room , his bedroom , only to find that he did n't have a bocce set , and he was super dehydrated . "
" He went back to his window , Luigi was in locked in form , literally ready to roll . "
 `` I do n't have a set . '' 
" `` Well I guess you 're going to miss out , Bella 's coming by to watch . '' "
" Oh Bella , Bella was the most beautiful girl the entire world . Bronze , tall , great credit , she was everything a man in Italy could want . But she was definitely married . "
 `` Bella is married is n't she ? '' 
 `` You really have been in there forever . Bollario was a Juventus fan and found out that Bella liked Torino . The marriage was over a long while ago . '' 
 Mario realized he had to play . He had to bocce his way into Bella 's heart . 
 But how ? How could he roll something pretty heavy down a grass lawn ? 
" Now , the heart works faster than the brain sometimes . Such was the case with Mario . He moved swiftly towards his meat cubes , and balled each of them into a large ball , putting them in the freezer . "
" His moment of regret washed over with visions of Mario , winning bocce , Bella jumping up and down in celebration , totally remembering who he was . "
" `` Mario , she 's here ! We 're going ! '' Luigi yelled from the yard . "
" `` I 'll be down there right on time ! '' Mario said , taking his ice cold , weighty meat balls out of the freezer , and arriving to the bocce ball game 15 minutes later . "
" If any of you have seen a meatball before , you know that it 's not going to roll like other balls . However , because there was no meatball before this moment , nobody realized that . You could hear Mario 's heart shatter as his meat bocce ball stopped dead in front of him . Bella yawned . "
" Wrecked with shame , not helped with the zealous laughter of Luigi . Mario returned to his home , never to leave again . Meanwhile , Luigi had a nice dinner with Bella and even had the foresight to put Mario 's now thawed out meatballs onto some spaghetti . They of course , died of salmonella shortly after , because uncooked meat that has sat in the sun for two long gets infected very quickly . "
" Listen , nobody knows how the meatball was invented , just enjoy it ok .
Somehow I ended up playing the detective . The mission commander did n't want anything to do with the investigation but said someone had to figure out how Jones died . I was reluctant , even after everyone voted it should be me . I guess I was the only logical choice , having spent part of my career working for the FBI crime lab . "
" <newline> We knew it was murder . You do n't remove your own helmet in atmosphere like that . Especially not since the helmet requires a latch to be flipped on the back , past where you can reach with the suit 's limited mobility . So how do I find out who did it ? After checking all the station 's cameras , it 's obvious there was someone with Jones when he went through the airlock . That 's not good . "
" <newline> I decided to begin questioning . I talked to the whole crew . I could n't pin a motive on anyone . Jones and Martin were known lovers . Martin had an air-tight alibi as she had been in the lab , and was recorded there on camera . She was so beautiful and perfect . Jones had been a lucky guy . "
" <newline> Watching the video of him suffocating to death had been tough . It was harder than seeing it in person .
I have to take someone with me when I go , that ’ s the rule . Whenever I stop time , I need a companion . It ’ s a weird rule , and one I don ’ t really see that much of a point in , but it makes for an interesting time . "
" I tried taking people I knew first , friends , family , classmates , girlfriends , but the trouble was their brains just couldn ’ t process it . During the time freeze they would either run off and do their own thing which they ’ d always wanted to do , or they ’ d go catatonic with shock and not do anything the whole freeze . That might ’ ve been alright , after repeated trips they would probably get the hang of things and we could have some proper fun , but the trouble was after the freeze they convinced themselves it didn ’ t happen . "
 Some of them would claim they had been drugged by someone . Others would tell me it was all just a lucid dream . When I asked how I remembered the events the same as they did if it was just a dream they told me that they must have already talked to me about the dream and got so excited by it that I had one of my own . It ’ s amazing how far people will go to maintain their perceptions of reality . 
" I had a problem then . If I couldn ’ t take anyone I knew , who could go with me ? There was no way I was letting this power go to waste , so who should I take along ? After family I tried starting the freeze out with someone then ditching them . That didn ’ t work , as soon as they were out of sight time resumed as normal . "
" Next I tried random people from the gym or the coffee shop , but most of those people either fainted or called the cops on me . Or called the cops and then fainted . I don ’ t think the police had a complete description of me yet , so I stopped trying random people from shops . "
" This was really beginning to irritate me . I needed someone who I didn ’ t know , but who had seen enough weird stuff that a little magical time freezing wouldn ’ t completely weird them out . "
" That ’ s when it hit me . I didn ’ t think it would work . I mean , how could this not end badly ? But I was running out of options , so I gave it a try . "
" “ Hey man , I don ’ t have any money , but I ’ d love to take a walk around the city with you. ” "
" “ I appreciate the offer friend , but you don ’ t want to walk with me . People give the homeless weird stares. ” "
" “ Well you know , I might have just the thing to fix that . ”

It has been fifty years since the inaugural re-distribution . Tomorrow we will go through another one . We ’ ll see how this great experiment has played out over the last half a century . "
" This process has been carefully studied , so I don ’ t think there will be any surprises . There have been some unintended consequences , both immediately following the last re-distribution , and the days leading up to this one . "
" As expected , there was a combination of despair and joy as those that were once wealthy saw their wealth disappear from their grasp , and as those who had little suddenly had a lot . "
 There were riots when those who had grown accustomed to the lifestyle their wealth had provided were suddenly thrust into a life of poverty . 
 Some had worked all their lives for their wealth . Others had inherited it . It was those that had inherited their wealth that started to riots . Those that had build up their wealth through their hard work felt some hope that they might be able to do it again . Though there were definitely people in that group that were just to tired to try again . 
" And then there were those that suddenly received a great sum of money . They had gone to bed on the eve of the re-distribution poor , and had woken up wealthy beyond their wildest dreams . Obviously , there was much celebration in this crowd . "
" Finally there were those whose lives didn ’ t change much . Their net worth had marginally changed in one direction or another . They may have been upset that they didn ’ t get more , but that was tempered by the relief that they hadn ’ t lost much . "
 As the dust settled on the first re-distribution a few things started to happen . The biggest of which was the utter lack of motivation on all sides . 
" Those that suddenly received a windfall hadn ’ t had any training on how to manage their new found wealth . Many of them squandered it on frivolous purchase , enjoying the things that had been out of reach for them in the past . It ’ s the common story of lottery winners . In a short amount of time they were back to where they were before . "
 The previously wealthy were able to re-capture some of their wealth from the luxury commerce that the newly minted wealthy were generating . But a lot of them also recognized that in fifty years they would be back to that precarious position . The memory of losing everything they had worked for made it difficult to risk spending their lives pursuing wealth when it could all be taken away arbitrarily . 
" So they stopped starting businesses , they stopped trying to invest their money wisely , and as a result there were less employment opportunities . The tax revenues went down in cities all over the world , so infrastructure started to suffer . "
" Everyone felt the tenuous situation they were in . Knowing that regardless of what they did , in fifty years all the wealth would shift again , and it was only chance that would determine who end up wealthy . And there isn ’ t any reason to try and accumulate wealth or build anything of substance , when it will all be randomly assigned to someone else in the not so distant future .
Johnny 's knife sang as its blade pierced the rapist 's gut . Blood spurted onto Johnny 's cerulean mohawk and pierced face as Katherine , her shirt in tatters , watched on . "
" Above the three mortals , invisible to all of them , were three beasts . The first was a blood-red hellhound . fire burned in its six eyes and it lashed its twin tails as rows of serrated teeth tore furiously into the rapist 's guardian . Floating above the Rapist was a black Ram ; its coiled horns twisting gruesomely into the hellhound 's fiery skin . Its hooves kicked and writhed as the dog 's flaming claw slashed open the demon 's belly and eviscerated its entrails . Standing next to and consoling katherine was a lamb . Ascalon 's Three eyes peered worriedly at her charge as she whispered prayers . "
" Johnny 's knife stabbed its last as the hound tore the Ram 's head off . With a heavy sigh , both possessed and demon fell back into the underworld . Johnny dropped the knife and stumbled back into the alley wall , his legs buckling beneath him as he trembled under the weight of his justice . Katherine crawled over , leaning against the wall next to her good samaritan . "
" When the two caught their breath they talked . Thanks , forgiveness , tears , names , life , even God was mentioned . Ascalon eyed the Hellhound suspiciously . It was licking its wounds above Johnny when three of its eyes drifted down to the lamb . All six widened in shock . "
 `` Ascalon ? '' 
" Demon voices do n't change . Their appearance does ; It fluctuates with their power and sin , but an angel 's voice never wavers . So it was that after 600 aeons Ascalon recognized her old friend . "
 `` U ... Uriel ? '' 
 `` It 's been a long time . '' 
 Ascalon 's third eye slammed shut as her remaining two glowed with rage . 
 `` I never thought I 'd see you again . '' Uriel continued . 
" `` Do n't talk to me , Blasphemer ! You betrayed HIM ! You betrayed me ! '' "
 `` Ascalon you know why I did it . I explained it to you but you were so deep in that tyrant 's pocket you would n't listen . '' 
" `` You dare to call HIM a tyrant ? You , who worship The morning star ? ! '' "
" `` He 's lied to you , Ascalon . Or at least he would , if he did n't rewrite the truth every time he needed to . Hell is nothing like that . I joined Lucifer for my own reasons . How conceited Jehovah is ! To actually think that separation from him was a punishment ! What do you think we were fighting for ? "
 `` DO N'T YOU DARE TAKE HIS NAME IN VAIN ! '' 
" `` Ascalon , calm down . I understand that you're- "
 `` You understand ? ! How could you possibly ? ! You betrayed me . I saw Michael himself cut you down at the battle of Jupiter ! '' 
 `` Ascalon that- '' 
 `` You 're despicable . how could you be so selfish ? I thought I knew you . I thought- '' 
 `` DO YOU THINK I ENJOYED IT ? '' 
 `` ... What ? '' 
 `` I saw you too . Do you think I took pleasure in your anguish ? Did you think I reveled in throwing aeons of joy away ? '' 
 `` Of course ! Only a demon- '' 
" `` I may be a demon , Ascalon , but I never stopped being Uriel . I do n't know how you deal with it . How can you call it free will if he makes all the choices for you ? '' "
 `` Freedom is the liberty to do what you were meant to . '' 
" `` I envy you , Ascalon . I 'm glad that you can live with a given meaning , but that 's just not enough for me . It never was . '' "
" `` How ca n't it be ? HE 's infinite ! You could come back with me . Please , HE 'll forgive you . HE 'll solve your problems with a snap of the fingers . Things can be like they were ... '' "
" `` Is n't the demon supposed to tempt you ? I appreciate it . I love you , And I almost love him , but his existence is simply too constricting on mine . '' "
 `` ... I 'm sorry . ''

`` Well.. what do you think ? '' I slowly come to the realization that my new wispy-tailed pal is still here , seemingly gazing right through me . I had been staring at his tapered body , entranced by the way it wagged around like a tail . I swear every time this `` tail '' starts `` wagging '' near my brother 's bong my heart skips a beat . "
" `` About what ? '' I ask , giving zero thought into what he is saying . "
" `` Jesus man , stay with me . I was asking about your first wish ... '' After no response , he waves his hand in front of my face . `` Anybody in there ? '' "

" `` Oh , shit ! '' He blurts out . I jolt up and starting glancing around . `` No , it 's nothing . That 's just kind of a lot for your first time . It 's cool though , you 're fine do n't get paranoid . "
" `` Okay , `` I pause . `` Has anyone ever died from smoking too much ? '' "
 `` Dude stop you 're fine . And you 're freaking me out . What 's your wish ? '' He looks at me expectantly . 
" `` Uhh . Okay . Can the wishes all be the same ? '' I 'm starting to think up a plan , and feeling real clever about myself in the process . "
 The genie chuckles to himself . `` No that 's dumb . '' 
 `` Well then I wish that they could . And I want to use them all on this wish . ''

His little princess as I had come to call him at first refuse . When the smoke touched his eyes , he complied . I aimed my pitchfork gun j the the mist and listened . It was too quiet . <newline> A face emerged through the fog , grotesque and disfigured , another jew . How many did this guy piss off that ended up down here . I took another shot and the creature fell to the ground . I moved through the fog as it began to clear away . Two bullets left and what I could only imagine an army waiting for us . <newline> But that was not the case . The few stragglers left began to run away into the abyss . <newline> I gave a quick smile and found princess again . He would n't take his mask off now .

At first he was confident he was mad . What other conclusion could possibly be drawn from such absurd circumstance ? His wife and daughter were taken from him , ran off the road and pinned beneath the twisted wreckage of their cramped two-door sedan by a careless drunkard who quickly fled and left the two for dead . He and his son were driving separately , happy after a family night out , unaware that a mother and wife , a sister and daughter , were about to be unfairly stolen from them . He did n't take the news well . He did n't heal like others in similar situations had , and his heart was pieced back together haphazardly as he went through his day to day mechanically rather than with any purpose . And his son suffered because of it . He was left agonizingly ignorant of his child 's suffering until one day ... "
" ... A melody . A soft , sad , tinkling sound , similar to a music box as it winds down and slowly stills . The song tore him from his passive stupor , and his subdued demeanor turned to confusion , then panic , and finally anger . He searched for the source of the sound , tearing up cushions , pulling out drawers , overturning furniture , desperate to find the source of the sound to disprove his insanity . His son looked on , frightened at his broken father 's sudden outburst , the soft music growing in intensity , the gentle tinkling sound transitioning into an anxious melody with bellowing bass and frantic percussion . The song was deafening , and he ran from his home , leaving his son and the song . "
" He fled to the streets , confident the air would help him get his head straight . He had n't grieved properly , he 'd held everything in and now it was finally surfacing , that had to be it ! But as he walked , he moved past strangers , and with every one of them , a new song surfaced and assaulted his fragile psyche . A woman with a sallow sunken expression rang out with an erratic rhythm , a lazy guitar with a resonating bluesy twang . A man confidently posturing with long strides and a bright expression curiously crying out with a sorrowful violin , the melody drawn out and oozing emotion betraying the man 's expression . A couple walking hand in hand , smiling and radiating their happiness outward , their individual sounds merging into a beautiful song that accentuated each others , the melody expressing the joy that their smiles only hinted at . "
" He walked . He listened . He was still panicked , but at the same time he was fascinated with this new gift . He was still confident he was mad , but the idea was less alarming now . Every song , regardless of the emotion they conveyed , they were all so beautiful . He returned home after a while , his son 's melody again weak and sorrowful , seeing his father causing sharp sounds of panic to emerge as he stared with wide eyes , cautious of another outburst . He embraced his son , something he had n't done for a long while , and the song shifted again , the pained melody beginning to warm but still hesitant , the bass and percussion subsiding and transitioning into a clumsy guitar , as if uncertain how to make the melody work , an unfamiliar song with an unfamiliar instrument for a now unfamiliar emotion . "
" Time passed , and his gift grew . He learned to interpret others emotions through the songs their hearts produced , his son 's most of all . He worked hard to ensure his son was smiling and happy , the rhythm produced by him every day jovial and bright . He learned who to embrace and who to avoid , learned who was lying from erratic climbs and dips in an otherwise consistent melody . He learned what to say and to who , monitoring the shift in their cadence , and using this knowledge to steer conversations to happy conclusions . He made it his duty to make others happy , because for some reason , he still had n't found out how to do that for himself . "
" He met Tiffany a year after he 'd discovered his gift . He was confident in his interpretation of everyone he met by now , developing a sort of musical emotion theory that helped him and others . He was leaving work , his son staying the night at a friends and giving him the rare opportunity to be lazy at meal time . He stepped into the diner and took a seat in the back where the music resonating from the other patron 's was quieter , intent to eat and read and keep to himself for a change ... "
" It was jarring . A deafening sound filled his head , a loud static that caused him to glance around for a TV or radio , thinking it impossible for any individual to produce this noise . It was n't like the melodies he had grown accustomed to . He had encountered all sorts of people over the course of this last year , people who were openly grieving , others that were hiding their hurt , and even more on the opposite end of the spectrum living happy and exciting lives . The songs they made were each unique and drastically different , but they were all beautiful . This however ... This was wrong . "
" He glanced up , discarding his book onto the table as he peered outward past his furrowed brow
- So , what happened ? "
" Well , I 'm out chilling on my patio . Feet in the paddling pool , couple of beers and that fucking great new album Joey recommended on the speakers . "
" Suddenly some bloke runs up , panting and sweating . To be fair it was fucking warm that day , but he looked pathetic . He was whimpering and moaning that someone was trying to kill him . 'There 's something off here ' , I thought to myself , 'he 's either nuts or deserved what 's coming to him ' . There was something fishy about the man , a guilty , awkward look to him . "
" 'Calm down mate , what 's the problem ? ' I say . "
" 'Hide me , hide me , he 's coming ' , the guy goes , all high pitched and nervy . "
" By now I 'm suspicious as fuck and there 's no way I 'm hiding this slug of a man . And then , just as I 'm about to tell him to get to fuck , Joey comes legging it round the corner and down my path . "
 'Fucking peado cunt ! ' He yells . 
" Bloke tries to run but I trip him over . Gave him a right good boot . Instinct , right . Believe my man Joss before even speaking to him . And then , before I can ask even ask what 's going on , Joey has hit the guy in the temple with this fucking spade . Sideways on , like . I 've got ta be honest , I looked away but I do n't think he stopped hitting him for a while . "
" What you expect the man to do though ? This man was leeching on his 12 year old son . The man 's a brute . I apologise for my language , but I say it as I see it . Joey 's a good man , and you 've already proved the guy was grooming his son . Self defence , innit . "

`` This is seriously how you decide who gets omnipotent power ? Like this is n't some shitty joke you play on mortals for kicks ? '' I asked the man in the white robe in front of me . He had just finished up the Bruce Almighty routine before I could even ask about his authenticity . "
" `` Yes , there 's simply no way around it I 'm afraid , my child . '' He replied , His words , while quiet , were confident and soothing . "
" `` So you just pulled two random people from the globe to compete for their newly granted powers ? This competition is ridiculous ! You look so stereotypical and this is the random type of bullshit you come up with ? You 've got the robe , the beard , the staff , the sandals , fucking sandals ... '' I broke off incredulously . "
" `` Your opponent has already agreed to the terms and rules of this challenge . Son , I made you for this , accept this challenge and compete to replace me as God . Accept this and accept your destiny . '' He Spoke to me , his words coming out as a whisper yet hitting me harder than bricks . "
" My palms clammy , and stomach heavy I looked up to meet his eyes . They met mine , holding care and hopeful longing . `` I accept '' I replied , as excitement and relief swept over his features . "
" `` Amazing '' he said clapping his hands together `` , as of now the competition has started , first person who shits will lose . I wish you the best of luck . '' He said before disappearing .
I plopped into my seat next to Greg . He turned his head , glancing over at me , even though he was n't surprised that I would sit there . Greg was a middle aged man with a balding head and a sort of jolly persona . Nothing about his life was jolly though . "
" He quickly looked back down at his phone , typing furiously and muttering under his breath . "
" `` I 've tried it all , Jim , '' he finally said , shaking his head back and forth like a madman . `` Novelty accounts , memes , well-informed posts filled with information ( we both looked at each other and chuckled ) , but I just do n't know how to break out . '' "
" I nodded my head and motioned to the bartender . He was one of the lucky few that got karma rich . I sighed . I just did n't have it , and the most frustrating thing was I did n't know what to improve on . Getting karma was some sort of weird skill that will always remain unattainable . "
" I ordered a drink and then pulled out my phone , letting the back of my hand to rest against the sleek wood of the bar . I looked back over at Greg , still shaking his head and muttering . No family , no money , no faith . I did n't want to end up like that . "
 I knew what to do . 
" I pulled out my phone . I sent a text post on the subreddit that gave me the most karma of them all ( me_irl , they 'll upvote anything ) saying thank you for supporting me but that 's it . I 'm going die . "
" And to my surprise , after a few minutes of self-loathing reflection , my karma count went up and up . Countless replies of `` me too thanks '' flooded my inbox . I could n't believe it , I was rich ! "
 `` I did it ! '' I shouted . `` Top trending post on me_irl with only 200 upvotes and in ten minutes ! '' 
" I was laughing . I was crying . The faces seated at the bar were a blur , I felt Greg 's congratulating hand on my shoulder , `` free drinks on the house ! `` , `` me too thanks ! `` , my life flashed before my eyes , a life with an infinite amount future of possibilities . "

" You know , after so many stories like Frankenstein and Jurassic Park humanity should pick up on the idea that it isn ’ t smart to play God . But really it seems they never learn a lesson until it ’ s too late to act on the lesson learned . I ’ m not all that surprised their old God abandoned them when I remember that . Though , I admit I say that without knowing if there ever was another God but if there was they might have stopped me . Maybe they tried . "
" I think I had a name . It ’ s hard to say really because what do names matter when you ’ re God . I know how I came to be like this I think but it ’ s hard to say . I was no-one , a nothing , and of no importance to anyone . So when I had the chance to be everything I couldn ’ t say no to the men in suits . Really a lot after that is just pain and hazy memories that don ’ t exist anymore . "
" But I know , I know , yes I know that when I woke up I could do things . They said they wanted to create a weapon a shield a protector a new being a hope a does it really matter ? The problem with giving a nothing everything is that they feel like they can do anything . They are more than nothing , even more than average , and they are better than the people who gave them power . "
 I had power now . 
 They wanted to make me charismatic and I was better than they could have ever dreamed . I didn ’ t have to bother with niceties because people were my allies whether they liked it or not . They had to bow to me and it wasn ’ t hard to make them believe that it was their choice . Not that I bothered with that because I shouldn ’ t have to force them to realise that working with me and serving me and worshipping me was all that mattered because I had power now . 
" They wanted to make me a technological genius and I was better than they ever could have dreamed . Why should I bother with being a technological genius when I could just put the geniuses in the technology . Oh , they went along with it at first but once they realised they weren ’ t coming back out they kicked up a real fuss about it . I don ’ t like misbehaving followers . "
" Some of them I just locked away in those little voice boxes you find in kids toys which seemed a fitting punishment for childish behaviour . I suppose it could be compared to being locked in a tiny room with no doors or windows and never being able to leave . Not that such things exist anymore . I did feed them at least . Well , I did for awhile but I got so pre-occupied with other things that I forgot about it . They should have been honoured really I mean after all they were starved to death by someone with more power than they could ever comprehend . The others I just forced into compliance because why should I waste my time with weaklings who can ’ t see what I ’ m doing for them . "
" They wanted to make me able to create anything I imagined and I thought I was better than they could have ever dreamed . Before I could create , however , I had to destroy . After all it ’ s no fun playing in someone else ’ s sandbox . No , no , no I needed a blank slate and so I needed there to be nothing before there was everything and so I said that there should be nothing and there was nothing . "
 It ’ s why I ’ m not sure that there was a God before me . I undid everything and so if a God or any number of Gods existed they now did not . Of course I couldn ’ t just have nothing in the now . I needed there to be nothing in the future and nothing in the past and nothing in all the could have beens and what ifs that made up parallel universes . Everything that ever was and everything that could ever have been was now not . 
 So now there is nothing but me and so I am everything . 
 There ’ s just one problem . Everything else came to me so naturally but I can ’ t figure out how to create anything . There ’ s just me . There ’ s not even a void or a blackness or time to count passing because when I undid everything concepts like space and time were undone as well . It ’ s all just me . I am everything . 
 I am . 
 I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am God God is dead help me me me me I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am .

*whoosh* That 's the only way I can describe it . A sudden rush of air , with a sound like the beating of huge wings . Then , while I blinked at the sound , there were two men in my apartment . Each was sharply dressed in a suit and tie , one wearing grey and white , the other black and white . The one in grey was taller , well-built , like a football player or warrior . The other , in black , was slighter and more lithe , with the thin build of a distance runner or gymnast . Each had eyes that shifted from pools of liquid gold to molten silver , endlessly shifting back and forth . The one in grey had close cropped , yet stylish dark hair , and his companion had longer hair , straight , down to to his shoulders , and pure white . I gasped and backed away with a start , getting off my knees and pushing against the nearest wall . "
" `` Wh- who are you ? ! How did you get here ? '' I stuttered , trying to get the words out . I tried to sound tough , but it came out with a mousy squeak . "
" `` Well , brother mine , I guess he was n't expecting us ... '' The shorter of the two spoke first . He voice sounded like smooth jazz , with a lilt in odd syllables and a hypnotic musical quality . "
" `` Indeed , it appears not . Strange really , considering we 're here because he asked . '' The taller man 's voice was a crash of waves upon a rock . Powerful , commanding , the kind of voice you could n't ignore , even if you wanted to . he spoke again before I could respond . "
" `` We 're here because our father sent us here to answer you for him . You asked him a question , right ? '' His gaze burned into me with an intensity that made it hard to breathe . "
" `` You -- you 're father ? I did n't ask anyone anything . Just , please , do n't hurt me . '' Staring into those eyes , my false courage gave way and I settled for pleading . "
" `` Yes , yes you did . You asked him what the meaning of life was . He 's too busy to handle questions like that himself , but he sent us to answer for you . '' The tall man looked amused , with a slight smile on his too-handsome face . "
" `` I ... I did n't ! I swear . The only time I ever asked that was when I was ... praying ... '' Then it dawned me , smashing into my conscious like a wrecking ball . I prayed ... Then these men showed up , in a rush of wings . They were talking about their Father . Wait , these were angels ! God heard me ! He answered my prayer . "
" `` Ah , there it is . Now he understands you , brother mine . I suspect he now knows what we are , if not who . '' The shorter of the two seemed more serious than his brother , less flippant and frivolous . "
" `` Ah , terribly sorry about that , mortal . I am Michael , and this is my brother Lucifer . '' Lucifer ? ! Like the Devil ? I glanced fearfully at the smaller one , and then back to the liquid metal of the taller one , Michael , he said his name was . "
" `` Haha ! '' He barked out a laugh . `` Luci , that will never get old for me . They are all so afraid of you ! '' Lucifer looked more sullen now , bordering on upset . `` Oh do n't be so upset , brother . He could n't possibly know . '' Lucifer seemed to calm a bit , looking less angry and more resigned . I tried to finally find my voice . "
" `` Sorry , but is n't he the bad guy ? '' I was trying not to look at Lucifer , afraid he 'd take my soul or something equally bad . "
" `` You mortals , always so obsessed with him being the Fallen . That was your story , that you invented and believed . He has always been my brother , nothing more or less . '' Michael seemed to be losing his patience now , irate on behalf of his brother , it seemed . "
" `` The task , brother mine . He did n't pray for a history lesson . '' Lucifer seemed to be the responsible one , keeping his brother on target . "
" `` Ah , yes ! The task ! You asked our Father what the meaning of life was . He sent us to tell you ! Would you like to know ? '' I desperately tried to nod yes , how could I say no ? The fundamental human question ! I was going to know the meaning of life ! "
" `` 42 . '' Michael 's voice was completely deadpan , and I stared at him in shock for a moment . Like the book ? ! Seriously ? `` No no , I 'm kidding . Sorry . Your Douglas was was so fascinating . He really is a wonderful storyteller for your universe . '' "
" I breathed a sigh of relief . That would have been an awful answer , one that I could n't say I
Halfway through the four hundred and eighty-seventh game of chess , I looked up at the demon on the opposite side of the table . `` Why are we doing this again ? '' "
 He harrumphed disdainfully . `` Are you really that stupid ? You need to master all arts and tasks so that you may – '' 
" `` Yes , yes , I know , '' I reply , waving a hand to indicate impatience . `` Challenge for souls , yadda yadda . But why not just… not let people challenge me ? Why not just take their souls ? '' It seemed like common sense – to me , at least . "

`` Breaking news ! the dangerous offshoot of the IRA , known as the 'Kings of Ulster ' claimed 84 victims today in a brutal attack against a British police station .

" He turned off the television as the newsman began to drone on and on about the many he had killed . No one had yet put the pieces together that he was actually not a normal human . He was a powerful figure , practically a God , able to kill practically anyone , but he could not control himself . He had gone over the plans enough times to know that there were only 64 cops in that Northern Irish station , meaning that he had killed 20 of his best men . `` Oh well '' he said to himself as he approached the doorway , `` It does n't matter how many I killed , what matters is that no one sees the true point of today .

A boy rests his head on his pillow and stares at the ceiling . The day had been uneventful , and he had no joy to experience . He closes his eyes in an attempt to sleep , but hears a thud in his closet . He walks to it . `` Who interrupts my sleep ? '' "
" A deep voice answers , `` If you were asleep , your ears would not be working . '' "
" The boy smiles , `` Clever ... Can you make me smile ? '' "
 A few moments pass . `` Are you not afraid of me young boy ? '' 
" `` No . '' The boy answers nonchalantly . He truly felt no fear , but he felt curious and excited . "
" More silence fills the air before the being in the closet answers . `` Thank you , most that I have encountered flee before they even answer ... No . I can not make you smile young boy . '' "
" The boy scoffs , and returns to his bed . Attempting one more time to close his eyes . Then he hears a voice underneath him . The boy felt curious and excited once again . `` Who dares interrupt my sleep ! '' "
" `` I am sorry . '' A raspy voice of a man bellows . `` I have lost my pillow , and I have not slept for 5 days . The longer I do not sleep the grumpier and clumsier I get . '' "
" The boy rolls his eyes and decides to try and rest again . It frustrates him that despite two beings hiding in his own room , the day was still uneventful . Thoughts race in his mind , and an idea forms in his mind . "
" `` Sir , I might know where it is ! '' The boy exclaims . "
 `` Oh thank you ! '' A reply sounds from below him . 
 He walks over to his closet . `` Someone below my bed just told me that you are a bore to talk to . '' 
 `` A bore ? Why ... tell them I am sorry for being a bore . '' The voice in the closet replies . The boy gets frustrated . The boring day must end here . 
" He stands and thinks , there must be a way to be entertained . `` He told me that he 'd rip you apart once you fell asleep because of how boring you are ! '' "
 `` What ! ? Well I 'll will kill him first in his sleep before he kills me ! '' The voice replies with anger . `` Will you help me young boy ! '' 
 The boy lit up inside . `` Yes . I will tell you when to strike . I will exclaim the words *Masaya* . '' 
 He went back on his bed and talked to the voice below him . `` The person in the closet tells me he ripped your pillow into pieces ! He wants you suffer ! '' 
" `` He will pay for his treachery then ! Young boy , will you help me bring justice to this fool ! ? '' The voice replied with rage , shaking the bed . "
" The boy answered , `` Yes ! Once I say *Masaya* , it is your time to strike ! '' "
" The boy set a pillow for his head , excitement was tingling his body . He waited for a few moments , `` *Masaya ! * '' "
 The two beings jumped out from their places and ripped each other to shreds . Nothing was left of each other .

" The human body , though , is beautiful . They stand before me , bodies and souls bared . Mike looks intrigued , and Kyle is in tears . I try to ignore Kyle . I am so turned on right now . "
 Bill ca n't seem to take his eyes off the evidence of this . 
" He looks kind of pissed , really . Well , it ca n't be helped . The law is the law . "
" I lead my boys over to a group of chairs in the center of the room , and start handcuffing them to the rails . One by one . Slowly . This is my one chance , and I want it to last . "
" My breath comes in short , shallow gasps . It 's almost too much to bear . At least my hands are n't trembling any more . They know what I want to do . "
 I turn out the lights . There 's just enough seeping in through the curtains for me to see the men in front of me . Dark enough for their eyes to shine . 
" I check their bonds again , making sure everyone is secure , making sure no one can move . I check Kyle 's more carefully than the others . "
" With everyone secure , I begin to remove my clothes , one piece at a time . I stand before them in all my flabby glory , letting them drink in the sight , and wonder . "
" And then I pick up the knife .
My name is Joshua Jerky . I am an actor that is employed by the government to `` work '' at Nevada Test Site more commonly known by its illuminati pseudonym Area 51 . I just drive to the secret base and make it look shit is happen when it really is n't . My employer told me we do this , because it prevents from the actual illuminati to take of the world . I 'm not quite sure what this means . However , I do feel like we at Area 51 are illuminati . <newline> What my co-workers and I do is basically nothing , so we just goof off and send some made up sci-fi bull shit to the history channel . Believe or not , they took it and made it into a real show ! The history channel really liked our stuff , so they hired us while on the job at Area 51 . We became billionaires by the end of that year .
Oh , off the port side <newline> We spotted the shore <newline> A place full of dragons <newline> and treasures galore "
 But our excitement soon faded <newline> When off of the rise <newline> Came trundling three women <newline> Of monstrous size 
 *Chorus* 
 Yo Ho ! Raise your swords ! <newline> Three hellish lasses be runnin ’ these shores . <newline> The island holds dragons and treasures galore . <newline> But what does a dragon need guardin ’ for ? 
 The eldest was Gladys <newline> With cutlass in hand <newline> Hands that had often <newline> Strewn blood on the sand 
 A woman of violence <newline> A maiden of gore <newline> She made sure that none <newline> Stood long on the shore 
 *Chorus* 
 Yo Ho ! Raise your swords ! <newline> Three hellish lasses be runnin ’ these shores . <newline> The island holds dragons and treasures galore . <newline> But what does a dragon need guardin ’ for ? 
" Next , came fair Ingrid <newline> A beauty for sure <newline> With hair so golden <newline> And skin smooth and pure "
 But make no advance <newline> It shouldn ’ t be missed <newline> That this bonny lass <newline> Has brawler ’ s fists 
 *Chorus* 
 Yo Ho ! Raise your swords ! <newline> Three hellish lasses be runnin ’ these shores . <newline> The island holds dragons and treasures galore . <newline> But what does a dragon need guardin ’ for ? 
 Last there was Hilda <newline> A sight to behold <newline> Covered in mud <newline> From her head to her toes 
 But strangest of all <newline> She brandishes trees <newline> To help her fling sailors <newline> Back to the sea 
 *Chorus* 
 Yo Ho ! Raise your swords ! <newline> Three hellish lasses be runnin ’ these shores . <newline> The island holds dragons and treasures galore . <newline> But what does a dragon need guardin ’ for ?

`` Overpopulation '' "
" The man in the blue suit clicked a small remote in his hand and the screen filled with images of starving children , their eyes like rough marbles pushed not quite far enough into their heads , fantastic , horizon-filling cities that smoked and glowed like a dying fire , and , of course , the typical image of the Tokyo metro with passengers being crammed through the car doors by impassive uniformed men . "
" `` It 's reality . A horrible one . The time has come to rectify it , and the hour for half measures is past . We 're in a position to possibly , '' The man in the blue suit paused , dipping his chin in a show of humility , `` save humanity from itself . '' "
 The boardroom was silent . Smoke from various cigarettes and cigars drifted over the massive tabletop . Rain pattered on the window panes . 
" `` Mental projection , physical control . '' The man in the blue suit clicked his controller again , and now a video of a man walking appeared on the screen . Waves emanated from an unknown source and struck him . He stopped in his tracks . "
" `` This is a rough draft of what every man , woman , and child on earth will see . We can tweak the language , of course . '' Click . "
" The screen faded to black and a few crisp lines of text in a modern font appeared . <newline> 'Your free trial of Life has ended . Payment , in full , of one life must be completed within five minutes . ' "
" The man in the blue suit clicked again . The screen flicked to a scene where the same man was now standing on a city street . He blinked his eyes , staring at the people around him . An old man sat on a bench , waiting for a bus . The original man 's face became distraught . He stared at the old man , perhaps trying to judge just how old he was . His face changed , and his fist clenched . Suddenly , a man walking on the street behind the old man on the bench turned and wrapped his hands around the old man 's throat . A car accelerated , jumping the curb and crushing several people against the wall of a building . A crash of glass was heard and the body of a woman fell down into the street , her head cracking open on the pavement . "
" The man in the blue suit clicked the button again , stopping the video . "
" `` I think you get the idea . Total chaos for a few years . Maybe even a decade . But then we can rebuild- start over with the knowledge we should have had the first time . And the best part is- '' He leaned onto the table , looking at each of the attendees in turn . `` You all are exempt from the whole thing . '' "
 There was a slight pause . A cough . 
 `` All those in favor ? '' 
 A chorus of 'Aye ' 
 `` All those opposed ? '' 
" Silence .
Summit Street is mostly empty in the fading twilight . This is the rough part of town , where the homeless guys huddle around a fire in an old metal garbage can and compare their goods after a long day of scouring the city for spare change and recyclables . A ragged man is clumsily weaving among the trashcans and streetlights toward the group of men holding their threadbare gloves out to the fire in an attempt to get warm . They ignore him ; he ’ s probably one of the drunks who frequently get lost on their way home from the seedy bar one street over . "
" When he finally reaches the group , they all make a point of avoiding his gaze , until he makes an inhuman sound : half gargle , half yelp . He tries again to speak , slowly forcing out the words “ help , please , help. ” They stare at him as he produces a folded up picture from his pocket , obviously printed from a printer that needs a new magenta ink cartridge . With some obvious discomfort , and a few intermittent coughs , the man quietly says , “ This man killed my son . Have you seen him ? ” They all study the picture silently . The printed face is clean-shaven and handsome ; its owner is wearing a suit probably more expensive than what most people make in a year . He is smiling at the camera , but the smile doesn ’ t extend to his eyes . Those are blue and icy , calculating . They all say “ no , sorry ” and turn away – all except one . "
" Glenn doesn ’ t recognize the guy , but knows the sorrow of losing a son , and looks up to say something comforting . That ’ s when he sees the man ’ s eyes : a familiar icy blue , but no longer cold and calculating . Now they are sad and confused . This man has a scruffy beard , is caked with dirt , and has scabbed-over gashes on his face and hands . He ’ s wearing old , worn hiking-gear , but he is definitely the man in the picture . "
" Glenn takes the picture , and unfolds the bottom part of the page . The news headline reads “ Hiking Disaster : Local Businessman and Son Fall From Faulty Rappelling Rope , Son Dies. ” Glenn hands the picture back to man , who is now looking at him with hopeful desperation , and says “ no , sorry , ” turning back to the fire .
`` I 'm so sorry , she did n't make it through the night . '' I never knew how powerful words could be . How ridiculously terrible . How they can completely destroy someone 's life . 7 words determining how the years to come will be for someone . I wonder how they feel while they wait for us to come up to them . While they sit on those little benches stapled to the wall or crammed in those tiny rooms around a rumpled bed . Or even standing in a hallway endlessly pacing back and forth , like they 're trying to carve their fear and worry into the tiled floor . "
" I was going to stay with her all night you know ? But that 's not how how it works . Someone else needs the bed . Maybe someone who still has a chance or maybe someone who 's just going to be carted down like this poor girl . I stayed with her until they came to take her downstairs though . Everyone else had left . I guess I just did n't want to accept what happened . I mean , I became a doctor to help people . Here 's the non-living proof that I had failed . Ha ! Get it ? Non-living ! Gallows humor , I guess . "
" How did everyone find the strength to go on ? I 'm so drained and it 's only 1 am . Still have another 7 hours on the clock . When they came to roll her body out , I looked at the black bag and wondered , `` Why do we do that ? '' Cover them up so we ca n't see the person anymore . It 's like they never existed . All that 's left is a misshapen black bag with a serial number . The orderly had headphones in and tossed her inside the bag without any ceremony . Did n't she deserve better ? A solemn moment ? Not a twenty-something head banger treating her like cargo to be rolled around . "
" They called the family shortly after she was rolled out . They were on their way right after the call . A pre-funeral procession . I was left with the task of telling them what happened . She was my patient after all . My attending thought it was time I had one of these conversations . Hooray . No more safety net . Sink or swim ... sink or swim . It kind of felt like that , like I was drowning . It was suddenly hard to breathe and I felt the panic rising in my chest . How was I so sweaty all of a sudden ? "
" I did n't get long to stew in this medley of terror . One of the nurses at the station nearby let me know the family was downstairs , waiting in the hall on the first floor . So I took that eternal elevator ride from the third to the first floor . Hoping it would have a malfunction . Then I 'd be spared the task of having to tell them this news . It was weighing me down like Atlas ' great burden and crushing my spirit . But the doors opened and I stepped out , looking quite the `` professional '' in my crumpled scrubs and messed up hair . "
" This memory will be forever fixed in my mind . I turn to the right and see the family , the dad pacing and the mom clutching the two younger siblings tight to her chest . They look at me and I see something that breaks my heart . I see their eyes and I see in them the deluded hope that what they heard on the phone was a mistake , an error that the good doctor is here to correct . How can they not realize that I 'm about to pass to them the most Herculean of burdens ? They carefully study my face and when they see what 's behind it , a part of them dies . Their hope blinding and then gone in a fleeting moment , like a dying star in the night sky . Their eyes water , the mom hugging her kids even tighter as though her grasp is a shield protecting them from the truth . The dad clenching his fists so tight , they start to turn as white as the bone within them . Their hope is gone and I open my mouth to say `` I 'm so sorry , she did n't make it through the night . '' <newline>
... <newline> ... <newline> She was shaking , I was too , he was dead . Blood on my hands , I hoped there was still light behind my eyes . I never killed a man before , I never had to save someone before . I did n't feel good , or mighty . She broke , slumped to the ground , her body , a tremor as she sobbed . I dropped the knife , I turned to look at what I had done . She shouted my name through tears . He had so much red on his stomach , his throat was open too . I did that ? I did that , I had to . I said as much out loud . Again she shouted my name . I could n't touch her though . She is so white , and I have n't decided if now I am dark . I did n't feel tainted , my heart was still beating so fast . I took a long hard breath , he is dead and so is his intent , we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way . Again she shouts , but I 'm deep in thought . Another long breath . I came to a conclusion . I killed a man today , I did the right thing , I beat him to the punch , and I 'm still here and I still have to take care of her . "
" I told her to stand , nicely , I offered her a meek smile , and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do . I started to explain why , but fuck it , she ca n't hear anything , *she 's in shock Boone , get her inside* . I walk her up the street , she remembers she ca n't walk in heels . She sees the life on my hands , and that sets her off again . We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant . I sit her down , I go to wash my hands . I do it with my closed , I 'm not sure if I wan na look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink . I 'm not sure if I wan na be the voice on the phone to the police . I puke in the sink , maybe some got on my shoes . "
" What the hell am I doing ?
There is actually a moment – singular and separate from all others – that one can point to in the timeline of a life and say , “ There . That . That is the space between living and , well , not quite so much of it. ” "
" However , nobody actually takes the time out of their own days to make this sort of announcement about anyone else , because they tend to collect terribly disparaging looks when engaging in that sort of behavior . With a furrowed brow and pinched lips , most listeners eagerly attempt to physically engrave into their faces the signs of their mental efforts to reject all that the one pointing out that slippery ‘ moment ’ is endeavoring to assert . No one wants to believe that the life can leave someone ’ s eyes before they hit the ground . "
" It is , however , a pinch more kosher to point out that someone may have been dead living after they have actually hit the ground and been summarily buried . <newline> As family members and loved ones dig through the rotting remains of a life in the house , apartment , shack , nook , cranny , or wherever the recently deceased had spent the final years and months of their life , the habits and traditions of their existence emerge through pictures , clothing , colognes and perfumes , books , letters , terrariums , wrappers , receipts , loose nails , and scuffed floorboards . In death , a spotlight is shot directly onto the structural foundations of a person ’ s lifestyle , making it near impossible to ignore when obvious and terrible patterns emerge . "
" “ It feels wrong to even be saying this , but I just don ’ t see… there isn ’ t… I mean , what was he doing for the past thirty years ? ” "
 “ Did she ever get out of that chair ? Did she ever move ? ” 
" “ That last while he seemed fine , but , thinking back on it , I can ’ t remember anything we spoke about . We had conversations , but we never talked about anything that – and I hate to put it this way , you know – mattered . We shot the breeze , yeah , but it was… it was scripted , not improv . There was the weather , the kids , the economy , but he was nowhere in the middle of it . He used to make me laugh my lungs out at every other word when we were kids , but at some point he stopped saying surprising things , charming things , personal things . He stopped , and I ’ m not sure where , but it was a long time before all of this . The cancer didn ’ t do it . It was earlier . Much earlier . I swept it all under the rug , because I didn ’ t know what else to do . He wasn ’ t sick then . He was fine. ” "
" “ I know it sounds callous , but I couldn ’ t be sad at her wake . For the life of me , I couldn ’ t figure out why at first , but then I realized I had already been mourning her death for years now . She wasn ’ t there anymore . You saw it too , right ? That spark she always brought to the table had been ashes for a while . The lights were on , somebody was home , but they wouldn ’ t get up to answer the door no matter how many times I knocked . God , it hurt to see her all the time , but not be able to reach her . Goddamn . It was done before it was done , you know ? ” "
" It is okay to talk about those that died while still alive when actual , physical death is there to muffle the implication . It becomes acceptable to ruminate on how the dead were living at one point in the past with their nails in the soil , burying dreams , loves , aspirations , friends , children , and , that somewhere along the way , they lost the ability to lift their head up and gaze forward . Somewhere along the road , the focus on living gave way to a slow , loose descent towards an end . <newline>
I wake up at my desk . My stapler is gone . Somebody took it . "
 Who am I ? 
 There 's a note . 
" 'I did n't want to interrupt your nap but I took your stapler . I 'll have it back soon , or you can come get it if you need it '' "
 There 's no signature . 
 I walk through the aisles in the cubicles . Who are these people . They nod at me ? Do they know me ? 
 Do I know them ? 
 I see desks without staplers . Did someone take their staplers too ? 
 Someone is preying on staplers . 
 I will find it . I 'll have it back . 
 Someone walks by . 
 `` Have you seen my stapler ? '' 
 `` Uhm no '' 
 My stapler could be anywhere . 
 I come back to my cubicle . My stapler is still gone . There 's something different about my cubicle . 
" While I was gone someone lined with paper , drawings all over . A man with a weird tie , a boss with pointy hair . "
 There 's a sign . 
 It says 'they took my swing line ' under a picture of a red stapler . 
 Someone 's taunting me . 
" `` Uhm , what are you doing in my cubicle ? '' "
 A voice behind me . I turn around . He looks just like me . 
 Well he 's white and thirty and wearing a shirt and tie . 
 We 're actually pretty different now that I think about it . 
 `` Sorry '' I say . 
 This mad man is affecting all of us . 
 Where is my cubicle ? I wander until I recognize the scenery . My stapler is back . I look up . 
 Someone 's walking away from cubicle . I ca n't see there face . 
 I run after them . 
 They walk into an office . Try to shut the door . I do n't know if I 'll make it in time . 
 I burst through the door . 
" `` Oh hey , Bob '' says the man at the desk . "
 I think his name is Larry . 
 `` I put the stapler back in the right cubicle right . I stare at him . He flaunts it in my face . 
 `` Did you uh…did you need something '' 
 I keep staring . He has to break soon . 
" `` If this is about me catching you napping we actually encourage short naps . You can use the break room if you want , just uh…just do n't abuse it '' "
 This man is a sociopath . 
 `` Yeah I do n't mean to be rude but if there 's nothing else I 'm kind of busy so… '' 
" I leave , go back to my cubicle . "
 My staplers gone again . 
 There 's another note . 
" `` Sorry , you were away , needed your stapler for a sec . Come get it if you need '' "
 There 's a name . 
 Frank .

`` It 's about that time sugar . '' the young waitress said to the man sitting across the marble counter from her . <newline> Laying his fork down onto the white folded napkin he inquired , `` Time for what , hopefully my check . '' he chuckled to himself . <newline> `` You havent heard of her ? The lady from uptown who walks down here everday . '' she said twisting her hair , leaning on her right arm . <newline> She was referring to the humble , pile of a lady who strolled their rural town everyday . Hunching over a wooden cane , she frequented the businesses on the main drag here . At the shops , always looking and touching everything , at the restaurants ordering her food . Never touches the served meal . Barb was what everyone knew her by . <newline> `` You mean that ol ' bag that drifts down these streets , with white long hair ? '' pointing towards the window . `` I heard that lady used to have quite a bit of money . '' he stated . <newline> `` Ya thats her ... and that 's her famous rumor . '' the waitress said twisting a red gloss smeared smile . `` Oh look there she is now . '' she quickly said whispering to the man . <newline> The handle on the front door turned and pushed out , and a short statured woman , hunched over , strode slowly through the door . Wearing a red knit hat that looked homemade , her white hair curled out into tiny half-circles around the brim.She wore an emotionless face . <newline> Quietly at the counter the man begins , `` I wonder what she is gon na order today Carla ? '' <newline> `` Oh , she always orders the same thing , '' stretching closer to his ear she whispers , '' A bowl of tomato soup . '' <newline> `` Tomato soup ? '' his eyes widen . '' 59 cents at the grocery store , and she comes *here* and pays 4 dollars for it ? '' <newline> `` That 's right sugar . '' She said . `` Lem me go get her order real quick . '' <newline> She walks down the aisle to where the tired , return guest was sitting . <newline> `` What 'll it be today barbie ? '' pulling out her notepad and paper , already writing *tomato soup* on it . <newline> The old women cleared her throat in a dirty gust , and began to speak . `` It 's so hard to choose here ! Everything looks good . '' Running her finger down the page on the menu . <newline> `` Well you can have it all , if you got the money to do it . '' she jokingly said . `` Maybe if we hit the lottery huh Barbie ? '' <newline> `` Ya maybe so . '' barb mumbled . `` Well after a long thought about it , I think I 'll go with the.. '' pausing , `` tomato soup ! '' <newline> `` That sounds excellent dear . '' Licking her finger , and walking towards the kitchen to ladel the soup out of the pot . <newline> The man at the far end of the counter turned on his stool to face to lady a few seats away . `` Hey there barb . '' he blurts , `` What did ya decide on ? '' <newline> Raising her head and tilting it to see him , she answered , `` Well , I heard through the grapevine the cook here makes the best tomato soup ! '' <newline> `` You know , '' crossing his legs , `` That 's what everyone always says . 'Guess you picked the right thing . '' <newline> The waitress returned with the steaming red soup , swaying in a white cup . <newline> `` Here ya go , hot off the presses . '' As the she pushed the soup across the counter towards barb . <newline> `` Thank you miss.. '' looking around distressed , `` but uh.. I 'm gon na have to pass this evening . '' <newline> *She always does this* the waitress sullenly thought . *Why even go through the motion . * <newline> The lady struggling to lift off the stool and stand , turned around and mumbled , `` I 'm off to the nieces , you know how kids are ... never can wait around . '' <newline> She limped towards the door , turned the knob and briskly left the restaurant . <newline> `` What was that all about ? '' the man speaking down the counter . <newline> `` Oh you know , that 's just how she is . Always orders , never even touches it though . '' Placing the cup in the bin under the register . <newline> Grabbing her the wet rag in the bucket on the lower shelf , she notices something out of the corner of her eye laying on the counter . <newline> `` Oh my i think she forgot something ! '' worriedly she said . <newline> She bent over to see what it was and noticed a gold bracelet laying on the table . A diamond in the middle of every connecting piece . <newline> As she picked it up , a tag on the bracelet flopped over into her hand . <newline> It read , *To carla , My beautiful daughter . You always used to love the Tomato soup i made for you . Thanks for returning the favor . * "

`` Not yet '' , he said `` Not now '' . "
" `` Your mother '' said His Death , `` do you remember what she said ? '' "
" `` She said that she would meet me there '' , recalled the man . "
" `` And your children '' , replied His Death , `` who passed before you one by one '' . "
" `` The same promise , I know '' , said the man `` but I do n't want it to end like this '' . "
" `` You have passed the point of being able to die surrounded by family , '' said His Death , `` We both know that '' . "
" `` You have been a true friend to me '' , the man whispered , his face cast towards the floor so that tears welled up in his eyes , `` my last friend '' . "
" `` It has been hard for me as well '' , said His Death , reaching across the table to comfort the man . "
 And there was silence . 
" `` You will not die '' , said His Death , `` you 're only going home '' .
`` But Sir ... '' <newline> Bart put down his coffee and massaged the bridge of his nose . On his desk , the morning paper sat , as of yet unread . His vacation days were few and far between , and Bart liked to ease into his day whenever they occurred . <newline> Home phone numbers were reserved strictly for emergencies . <newline> `` Miss Simmons ... '' he closed his eyes , picturing the look of agitation that his secretary usually made in these sorts of conversations . `` Have I stressed to you exactly what I had planned for today ? '' <newline> The woman on the other lined sighed patiently . `` Yes ... *Sir* ... but- '' <newline> `` I was planning to spend the day with my family , '' Bart scratched the beard on his chin , `` My granddaughter Jesse just turned five years old . We were going to take her to the amusement park . '' <newline> Another sigh of muffled agitation . `` I 'm terribly sorry , Mister Cubbins . '' <newline> `` Are you aware of just how rare it is for me to even *get* a full day off work ? '' the old man said , now in full rant mode . `` I used to work for the most powerful man in Didd , and damn it all if I did n't appreciate the opportunity to do good work . '' <newline> He could imagine his secretary 's growing impatience on the other line , but the old man slowly rose out of his recliner , grabbing his cane and getting shakily to his feet , the house 's cordless phone in hand . <newline> `` I could have stayed in that dead-end job for the rest of my days , but damned if I did n't decide to make something of myself ! So I spent the next thirty years building this company from the ground up . It was a whole lot of hard work for very little reward , so I do n't think it 's so much to ask for a moment of peace and quiet every now and again . '' <newline> He heard the sigh on the other line indicating the end of his secretary 's patience , as many of his employees made when he went on such tirades , and he relented . <newline> `` So please , my dear , tell me , '' he said , sitting back down and idly glancing at the paper on his desk . `` Tell me what urgent matter demands my attention today . '' <newline> `` W-Well ... '' Miss Simmons sounded uneasy . `` You may want to be re-thinking your plans today , Mr. Cubbins ... '' <newline> The old man Bartholomew rubbed his eyes as took a second glance at his newspaper , and nearly dropped the phone , before shaking his head , thinking he must have been seeing things . <newline> `` What was that now , Miss Simmons ? '' he asked in a shaking voice . <newline> `` Sir ... '' Miss Simmons said hesitantly . `` Have you taken a look outside today ? '' <newline> Mr. Cubbins blinked and rose once again from his chair . <newline> It could n't be ... <newline> He hobbled shakily to his window and drew back the curtains , and then he saw the green sludge that fell from the sky . <newline> Then he began to laugh . <newline> Thirty years , and Derwin was still making the same old mistakes . <newline> `` Sir ? '' Miss Simmons said on the other line , not hearing him fully as the phone dangled limply in the man 's relaxed arm . <newline> Bartholomew put the phone back to his ear . `` Thank you , Miss Simmons , that will be all . '' <newline> `` B-But Sir ! '' <newline> He hung up the phone and placed it back into the receiver on his desk , before making his way out of his study and towards the back patio where a man , a woman , and a little girl were staring out the door in awe . <newline> `` Look grandad ! '' the little girl said in excitement as she ran towards him and grabbed his hand , urging him forward and pointing at the globules of green that were now splayed across the lawn . `` Have you ever seen anything like it ? '' <newline> The old man let out a breath , giving his granddaughter 's hand a loving squeeze . <newline> `` Once , my child ... '' he said , shaking his head . `` Once ... ''
`` Not today you son of a bitch . I see you . Not today . '' "
 <newline> The nurse gave a sidelong glance at the surgeon muttering in half-whispers almost too quiet for anyone to hear . But she heard . 
 <newline> The doctor did n't always mutter to herself . It was usually only in special cases : a car accident on the I-5 with a 16 wheeler that lost control ; an idiot college student deciding he can jump into a pool from three stories up ; or a 90 year old man who just suffered his third heart attack and whose wife was wailing in the lobby . 
" <newline> She only muttered when the case was going to be close . Her usual routine was to wash up , get gowned , and get to work . Dr. Cardea was the best at only 34 years of age . She always worked calmly , quietly , skillfully and when the job was done it looked as if she had never been there . "
" <newline> But on rare days , such as today , the nurse would notice an acrid smell would be lingering in the emergency room as she began her prep . It didn ’ t matter what case had gone before , or how well the room had been cleaned prior , the smell of decay would be wafting in the southern corner of the room . It was on those days that the nurse knew that her surgeon would break her routine . That she would stare hard into that corner , always the same corner , like she was facing down the death itself . "
" <newline> On those days Cardea ’ s blue eyes would change steely grey , she would mutter words that only I could hear , and then get to work . "
" <newline> Today was the same . As Cardea stepped forward to the table , to the newborn babe born a month too early with holes in his heart , she summoned all her skill and prepared to begin . "
 <newline> But today was different . The smell was stronger . It was closer . It was surrounding me . 
 <newline> At that moment she hesitated . She gave me a glare with such power I felt the need to run from the room in terror . <newline> But I didn ’ t . 
" I simply looked back at her calmly and said “ Let me help you with that Dr. Cardea . You see , I have an interest in him as well. ” "
"
She cried , the way she had when she when I first saw her . Tears cascaded from her eyes , her cheeks were red and a small amount of snot dribbled down her upper lip . "
 *I love her . I love you . * 
 Those were the first thoughts that came to my mind when I saw her . When she emerged from the womb and I set my eyes upon her beautiful face for the first time . I had cried too . 
 *I love her . * 
" It was soft in my hand , unrightly so . Something so simple has no right to be so powerful or wrong . <newline> Her fit continued . Her legs and arms kicked out as she lay on her back . Her cries became louder , more intense , a sound that once drove me mad . She was a crier ; she wasn ’ t like her brothers who slept through the night just after three weeks . Growth spurts , teething , hunger , all of it would send her into a spell . "
" But she had grown up tough . I ’ ll never forget when I saw her fall on the bike for the first time . The logical part of me let go , it pushed her away from me as the two wheeled vehicle moved across the pavement . But the fatherly side of me screamed . It shouted and pounded at the confines of my mind as I let go of my little girl . She wobbled and fell . It was my fault . The fatherly part of me took over and I raced towards her . "
 She was holding her knee and grimacing . Her eyes had begun to water but she hadn ’ t started crying . I went to pick her up and she stopped me . 
" “ I wan na try again , Daddy. ” "
" Softball had been the same . Countless days we would come home from games and she ’ d have an icepack or bandage on some burn she got from sliding into a base . She wasn ’ t the best , far from it actually , she was small and not as athletic as the other girls . But she had gumption . She had vigor . She was tough . "
 *I love her . I love you . * 
" And here she was , back as a babe before my eyes . "
" “ *To enter paradise you must be cleansed. ” * God ’ s words echoed in my mind . I stood on the precipice of eternity , hell in one hand , heaven in another . “ *Cleanse yourself of your most wicked thought and you may enter , my Son. ” * "
" She lay on a bed before me , her fit was about to reach its climax . As an early father the thought has crossed my mind , if only for half a second I wanted to be rid of the crying . I wished to sleep . Half mad , half sleep deprived , I wanted my independence back . But it was only for half a moment . It was only for the briefest of seconds yet it now defines my eternity . "
" The logical part of me told me it was not real . Told me that this was simply a test , no different than what Abraham had gone through . It said to do it and be done with it . To join my parents and brothers . To see my wife again . "
" But the fatherly part of me was ashamed , it screamed wrestled with the very real thing in front of me . It tore at my conscious and pitied what I knew I had to do . "
" The decorative pillow was in my right hand , it was small yet held giant repercussions . I knelt next to my crying daughter and lifted the pillow to her face . I started to cry with her . "
 *I love you…* 
" A flash of light , yellow and red , then nothing . I held her in my arms for the last time . The clouds and sky shot up before me but I did not move , the universe was moving for me . The world cascaded towards me , then <newline> everything went dark . "

 “ Push ! ” 
" “ I see the head now , you ’ re almost there , Dear . Keep pushing ! ” "
 She cried out and gave what little she had left . 
" “ There you go , almost there ! ” I gripped her hand and told her it was going well . I told her I was there , and that she was almost done . She wasn ’ t listening though . Thinking back on it , I think I was more talking to myself than her . "
" Then the room was filled with something queer , a new sound added to the chaotic cacophony : a baby ’ s cry . "
 “ It ’ s a girl ! ” the nurse exclaimed . She swaddled the baby in a blanket and extended her to me . 
" “ Here , ” she said , “ Congratulations , you ’ re a father. ” "
" I eyed my baby girl . My beautiful Olivia . She cried , tears cascaded from her eyes , her cheeks were red and a small amount of snot dribbled down her upper lip . I smiled . "

The walk up the driveway is as long and boring as usual . *This is why people have short driveways , * I think to myself , as I finally jog up the steps to my front door . After fumbling with the locks for few moments I enter inside , and smell the familiar scents of home . It always reminds me of Lucy , and it always makes me wonder when she 's coming back . "
 *Is she coming back ? * 
" I shake the thought away as best I can and throw my coat up on a hook before I head down the hallway , past the kitchen and into my study . I 'm practically *dreaming* of the butter biscuits I have saved from yesterday , but they 'll have to wait . If I do n't get this report filed , I 'm in deep trouble . "
" The air is stale in my study , which is n't a great thing . I 've been falling steadily behind ever since Lucy left , and I have n't been committing as many hours to work as I should be . Then again , maybe that 's why she left me . *John* probably does n't have a full time job . I bet *John* just vacations 5 days a week on Lucy 's dime . The money I won her in the lawsuit is definitely enough to cover that for a few years . "
 *Could you stop thinking about her for one goddamned second ? * 
" I shake my head again , and decide the butter biscuits are becoming more of a necessity for me than anything else right now . So I drop my work bag off at the desk and walk around the corner into my kitchen , where I stop short as all thoughts of butter biscuits fly from my mind . "
 There 's a white grand piano . 
 In my kitchen . 
" There was n't one before . But now there 's a white grand piano in my kitchen nook , right where my table used to be . "
" `` What the fuck , '' I say aloud .
Hi . I 'm Jim . I may just be a sapling at the moment but one day I want to be human . I see them running around , on legs and feet , flailing their arms , jumping , dancing ; Free . They know how to stay warm , how to move no matter whether the sun is near or far . They breathe air . Oh , of course photosynthesis is close but every time I grow , it 's a step towards being a part of Mother Plant . She 's the one who makes the giant balls and sends them up to the sky ; planets is what I heard a human call them . The planets are beautiful once they reach the nighttime sky , they shine to be the brightest stars . It 's a big task The Mother has , to fill the nighttime sky with stars so beautiful they light the whole sky . But humans ... well what can I say ? They 've chosen their own paths , each path being so different from another ... I ca n't help thinking that maybe , just maybe I do n't belong here . Maybe I can do more than make planets . Maybe I could dance and shout and ... and ... ... RUN .
The night started like any other , I sat dealing cards at the tavern in Arkansas . The usual crowd came in . They 'd all learned long ago not to gamble with me as I 'd paid for my drinks off their losin ' for as long as I can remember . I always won , be it by bluffin ' , cheatin ' , or just plain luck . "
" This night , a stranger walked in the door . He was dressed in black with a new pistol on his belt . Not stopping at the bar , he sat at my table . He laid down his money , so I matched , shuffled , and dealt . A poor hand for me , but he seemed little better . He asked for 3 new cards and so did I . He did n't look at me after that , just placed some coins on the table . All I had was ace high and he seemed too confident for less than a pair . He did n't seem the type to be scared off by a bluff , so luckily I kept an ace in my cuff . I matched his bet and switched the cards while he focused on the money . we laid down our hands . He had a pair of jacks , beaten by my aces . As I scooped up the money , he grabbed my cuff . He pulled out the card , and I took off running . "
" The midnight train was loping down the tracks behind the bar . I turned the corner and grabbed the ladder of a passenger car . Luckily the whole train was empty . As I closed the door behind me , I heard the rapport of his pistol , but I never felt the shot . I plopped down in the chair and stared out the window . The bullet had gone right through , but I was n't gon na make it long . "
" Maybe an hour later , I could n't tell , a young man boarded the train . He looked distraught , but silently sat across the isle and too stared out the window . Every now and then he 'd take a long drink of whiskey . I was happy to just sit , but after a while , I had to say something . "
" `` Son , Ive made a life out of readin ' peoples ' faces , knowin ' what their cards are by the way they hold their eyes , and if you do n't mind me sayin ' , I would say you 're out of aces and for one taste of your whiskey , I will give you some advice . '' "
" He pulled out his bottle and handed it to me though there was n't more than a sip left . I happily drank it down , glad to have a last taste of the smoky liquor . I asked for a cigarette and a light . I hoped they would still my shaking hands . I took a long drag and waited a moment . "
" `` If you 're gon na play the game , boy , you better learn to play it right . 'Cause every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep , and every hands a winner just like every hands a loser , and the best that you can hope for is to die in you 're sleep . "
" You got ta know when to hold 'em , know when to fold 'em , know when to walk away , know when to run . Dont ever count your money while you 're sittin ' at the table . There 'll be time enough for countin ' when the dealin ' is done . '' "
" He seemed more comfortable , but lost in thought , so I turned back to the window and finished my cigarette . My hands had stopped shaking at least , but my feet were cold . I put the butt in the ash tray and dozed off .
“ Deadlift a word. ” "
" “ Deadlift , can you comment on the ongoing trials ? ” "
" “ Deadlift , how was the break up with Mistress Blue ? ” "
" A large man pushed through the crowd to get into the bank . He hadn ’ t wanted this for his life . His cloths shedding layers of wood chips and saw dust as he maneuvered into the bank . Everything had been so simple . Go out , bid a job , do the job , bid the next , then work at habitat for humanity on the weekends . This had been life for nearly 15 years . Then one day the powers came . People were flying , shooting lighting from their fingertips , all while Dave found the shingles lighter . And he was happy with that . He knew the day would come when he would learn the true extent of his strength . But he was in no rush to find out . He was just a charitable guy , not a hero . The next Monday , He had saved the life of an excavation crew when the ground beneath them gave way . Lifted the excavator straight up while the other members of the crew pulled out the injured . He spent the next week in his bed nursing a strained back . Super strength and adrenalin allowed him to lift it and he had never quite found that much strength again . But even if he couldn ’ t lift a digger like that again , it had earned him is name : Deadlift . "
 “ No comment ” 
" Dave walked in to the bank , late , foreclosure notice in hand . There was nothing the bank was willing to do over the phone , so he ventured into public . Past the people cheering for Deadlift , past those that looked at him with disgust . They were probably family members of the victims of the recent cave in . He could only save 5 of the 20 workers . He was forced to stop twice along the way . Once for a kite in a tree , once for a robbery in progress . Clamping the barrel of the gun closed , the robber pulled the trigger blowing the gun in to shards of shrapnel . The crook told him to expect a call from his lawyer . "
" “ I ’ m sorry David , there ’ s nothing else we can do for you. ” The loan officer said . "
" “ Please , I ’ m bidding a job tomorrow . I can get an advance and pay off my late dues ” "
 “ You ’ re out of time son . I ’ m sorry. ” 
 Dave stood to leave . 
" “ Oh , before you go , could you sign this picture . My grandson loves Deadlift. ” "
 “ Really ? After telling me that you ’ re taking my home you want a fucking autograph ? ” 
 “ There ’ s no reason to be rude about it. ” 
" Dave grabbed the pen and the picture , snapping the delicate pen in the process . He flung the door open , crushing the handle . He walked out to the table with the pens on the chain as the paparazzi forced their way into the bank . "
" “ Deadlift , What ’ s the news on your charity appearances ? ” "
" “ Deadlift , any comment on the recent YouTube video of you drunk in public ? ” "
 “ No comment . Backup. ” 
" “ Deadlift , Is there any truth to the accusation that your burst the water main on fourth , leaving the hospital without water ? ” "
 “ No . Please back up. ” 
" A shorter bald man stepped up , setting off a flash in Dave ’ s face . "
" “ Hey Deadlift , that a foreclosure notice in your hand ? With all these lawsuits I guess you ’ re just as bad at keeping the lights on as you are at keeping people save ” "
 “ I said back up ! ” 
" David swung his left hand into the paparazzi , sending them flying into the wall . "
 “ I ’ m…I ’ m sorry ” Dave muttered 
 The bald paparazzo stumbled to his feet . 
" “ haha , Deadlift assaults journalist . This is a great story and my shoulder is killing me . Thanks for the payout you lug ” he said , snapping a picture . "
 In the span of the flash Dave was arm ’ s length from the paparazzo . Dave grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into the wall . 
 “ Do you know what it ’ s like to be a hero ? Do you know what you get for putting your life on the line ? ” 
 He tightened his grip . 
 “ A camera at every window ! ” 
 His fist slammed into the paparazzo face 
 “ Walking down the street every child has a kite or some fucking cat up a tree ! ” 
 His fist again . 
 “ While I barely make enough for to pay my way ! ” 
 Again

 “ Is this your serialized fanfiction ? ”

 With weapons drawn and tempest minds yet violent 
 They wait and hide in cloaks and capes and hoods .

 `` Alright . Is *everyone's* phone on silent this time ? '' 
" Jenny shuddered , remembering her first trip with the group , only yesterday , involving an escaped tiger and an angry elephant . Set off by a blaring ringtone . "
" `` Okay , good . '' Jenny snapped her head back up , trying to seem like she had been listening . It was no use . Charlotte gave her a long look . "
" `` Jenny , you 're with me , '' the group 's 'leader ' continued . `` Everyone , get into your pairs and lets go . '' "
" Automatically , the huddle of 8 girls split into four pairs . Jenny felt Charlotte yank at her arm . "
" `` What was her name again ? '' Jenny asked quietly , pointing to the tall girl with red hair lounging absent-mindedly against the solid stone wall of the museum . "
" `` She 's Nikki ... but it does n't matter for now , we 'll be just on our own for this mission . Chin up , Newbie , you 'll learn everyone 's names soon enough . '' "
" *Mission , * Jenny thought to herself . *More like Death Wish . * She berated herself for joining the rag-tag team . All because she wanted to fit in in her new school . "
" Jenny brushed the hair from her eyes and looked around- had the older girl ... Charlotte ... left her ? Her eyes caught on the familiar figure standing tucked against a dimly lit staircase , motioning for her to follow . "
" They walked in silence , the distant buzz of fluorescent lights the only noise to be heard . Charlotte turned to face the new-recruit . "
 `` How old are you ? I never asked ... '' 
" `` Um , 14 , '' Jenny said , tugging awkwardly at the sleeves of her hoodie . The rest of the gang seemed older- would Charlotte laugh at her for being so young ? "
 Jenny 's mentor only nodded wisely . `` I was that age when I joined . I 'm only 16 now . And I 've been here the longest . '' Jenny felt a little weight lifted off her shoulders . 
 `` Really ? '' 
 `` Yeah . And Miranda was only 15 . '' 
 Jenny shuddered . *Was* . All she knew about 'Miranda ' was that her position was suddenly empty- and Jenny had filled it . There was no doubt that Miranda had died during one of the gang 's so-called missions . 
" Charlotte thrust an arm out in a 'stop ' signal , interrupting Jenny from her thoughts . She had just enough time to mutter 'what the ... ' before the older girl clamped her hand over Jenny 's mouth . "
" `` Warden ... '' Charlotte hissed . The pair watched in concentrated silence as a fat man in uniform wandered past , swinging torch from side-to-side lazily . "
" Jenny let a second pass before she allowed herself to breathe . They were in the Lockhart Museum , home to the world 's most famous pieces of art ... and the exquisite ancient chinese urn that the girls were about to steal . "
" *No laws for us . We can do whatever we want ... * Jenny reminded herself , repeating the thought like a mantra in her head again and again . It did n't help to stop the niggling worry in the back of her mind . *But that does n't mean the electrified security systems are disabled ... * "
 -- - 
" Charlotte and Jenny worked in silence , sawing- quiet as a mouse- through the cables . They were the thickest cables Jenny had ever seen , and wire cutters seemed useless to them . The two of them had resorted to the little saw on Charlotte 's pen-knife , each taking over when the other got tired . They were making progress , but slowly . "
" `` Charlotte , '' "
" `` Mmm ? '' Charlotte continued to saw , beads of sweat forming on her temple . They were pressed for time , and they both knew it . `` If you 're about to say 'saw faster ' do n't . '' "
" `` I wo n't ! '' Jenny exclaimed under her breath , scared to talk at normal volume after a run-in with the mechanical attack dog roaming the halls . '*Security measures these days ... * Charlotte had remarked . `` It 's just . Charlotte is a bit of a mouthful , do n't you think ? '' Jenny swallowed . *Please be cool , please be cool ... oh god I 'm trying too hard ... She can tell ... * `` Sh-should I call you Charlie instead ? '' "
" Charlotte gave her a dark glare . `` No . Absolutely not . '' She picked up the saw and handed it to Jenny . Her hands were red and raw , but the cable was almost done . `` Here , your turn . You can do the last bit ... '' the teenager took a swig of water from her water bottle . `` *Never* call me Charlie , okay ? That 's a name for try-hards trying to look tough . I 'm naturally awesome , I do n't need some shitty nickname based in my insecurities . '' "
" Jenny took in Charlotte 's cropped hair , dyed
The camera sat on the table , just waiting for use . <newline> Years had gone by , and temptation grew , thinking about what it knew . <newline> Objects , the only thing it had seen , how could that be ? <newline> Seconds and minutes gave a goodbye , I needed to know what it thought of me . "
" I took a step , a step closer indeed . <newline> I peered over , grabbing it with need . <newline> In front , was a mirror , my reflection beaming . <newline> What would it tell me ? Unsure I seemed . "
" Through the lens , I looked , <newline> How ugly I appeared , nothing like the words of a book . <newline> As invisible as I was , I understood . <newline> The camera I had used , was abused , not as it should .
`` Some things can not be done by day . The sun is an eye of god , bringing judgement onto our sins . And some sins may not be forgiven . That is why , we , the Night Shift , do what we do in darkness . It is not for secrecy , but for shame .

 `` Shut up George . '' 
" `` Tonight we create an abomination . We tread upon God 's feet , the folly of humankind - '' "
" `` No more of this shit , George ! If you want to go onto these fucking monologues , you should have been a fucking writer . '' "
 `` Screw you too Blake . '' 
" Blake moved up to adjust the camera . It began to focus onto his scrubs and his surgical mask . He pointed it onto the podium where a mechanical sphere lay , connected by wires into the building . "
" `` We 're copying a human mind . The wires lead over to our patient . Who is n't being tortured by demons in the basement , like George 's monologue would have you think . Completely painless procedure , just tracking brain signals and the like . It 'll take a few hours or so to install . '' "
 Blake pointed over to a human body made of chrome and silver metal . 
" `` That 's the body we have housing the metal brain . Should be an exact replica of our patient , except a cyborg . Pretty damn cool , huh ? '' "
" He shifted the camera , panning to a rather smug looking Greg . "
 `` *INSTALLATION COMPLETE* '' 
 Blake hurriedly aimed the camera back at the brain and body . 
" `` Well , that was a lot faster than I expected . '' "
" `` Yeah , Blake . You 're welcome . Turns out that my genius mind is n't just good at monologues . Turns out I 'm pretty good at a lot of stuff , huh ? '' "
" `` Yeah , George , good work . Say , how do we put it in ? '' "
 `` You do n't know ? Is this another thing that I 'm useful for ? '' 
 `` Oh seriously ? I 'm a god-damned doctor and psychologist . You know I do n't work with machinery like this . '' 
 `` Then watch as we commit the ultimate sin of pride by recreating God 's own work . '' 
" As George placed the brain into the body through the top of the skull , wires left small holes in the brain , exploring its new storage . They latched onto small connections within the head of the machine body . George lifted his hands from the brain as the hole closed shut . Cameras came out of where its eyes should have been . It whirred , moving its hand in front of its face , as though making sure it were well and truly alive . "
" `` It 's alive ! '' Blake shouted . The Frankenstein reference was ignored by George , who eagerly studied the robot . A speaker emerged and it spoke its first words . "
" `` An abomination ! Oh , never let me see the light of day , for it will melt through to the metal core of me ! I was never meant to live ! '' "
" Blake paused , in shock . George stood by the robot , still smug as all hell . "
 `` George ... . You did n't ... '' 
 `` Yup . '' 
 `` Do you have any idea how much is at stake here ? '' 
 `` Of course I do . I know my own intellect is far greater than our patient 's . Hence my actions . '' 
 `` George you little fuck ! You just copied yourself into our only robot ! The ! ONLY ! ONE ! IN THE WORLD ! '' 
 Blake chased George as he dodged around the table in circles . The robot watched them passively before turning towards the camera . 
" `` Ah , humanity . ''
“ I need an *army* of *mole men* , ” the very-creatively-named Mole Man shrieked . “ With noses that can detect incoming heroes from *miles* away . And big gnashing claws ! ” He held up his own hands and wiggled his stubby fingers , no doubt imagining them with claws . “ And… and… giant… ” "
" “ I think I get what you ’ re going for , ” I interrupted him with my most calming tone . Sometimes these villains can get a little worked up in describing their dream henchmen . “ We can certainly offer you the very best mole minions to do your underground bidding , Mole Man. ” I ’ d gotten quite good at suppressing my urge to laugh while working here . “ They ’ ll have claws like you ’ ve never seen before ! And they ’ ll be great diggers. ” "
" “ Excellent ! ” His nose twitched wildly like a scared mouse , and he rubbed his hands together in that way that all villains seem to pick up from each other . But he did it a bit *too* enthusiastically ; it nearly sent the 4 ” 5 ’ man toppling off of his chair . “ And you say they ’ ll be part man , part mole ? ” "
" “ Absolutely. ” I swiveled in my chair and dug through my stack of pamphlets . Past the robot and/or cyborg option , past faceless soldiers with so-called weapons training , past super ninjas with troubled pasts… “ Ah , here we go ! ” I plucked the human/animal genetic abomination pamphlet off of the rack . “ You are familiar with our work on Grizzly ’ s bearmen , yes ? ” "
 “ Of course ! ” He was starting to get that wild gleam in his eyes that meant the deal was pretty much done . Supervillains are the biggest suckers out there . You show them a shiny new toy like an army of human-bear hybrids and they just *have* to have one of their own . “ Most excellent work. ” 
" “ We can absolutely do mole men for you , ” I said . “ We just need you to sign our standard form contract here. ” I pulled one of the binders from my drawer and thumped all six hundred pages of it onto the desk . Mole Man ’ s eyes widened behind his coke bottle glasses . “ Just a standard agreement , saying that we will provide you with the best army that money can buy. ” "
 “ 600 pages to say that ? ” he responded . 
" “ Well there are the standard legal disclaimers… ” I said . Like that we make no guarantee of their combat abilities or training . Or that they ’ ll even be semi-competent henchmen . Once they leave the lab , they ’ re not our responsibility anymore . “ But come on . You ’ ve *seen* those Bear Men in action , right ? ! ” "
" Mole Man forgot all about reading over those disclaimers and signed immediately . They always do . I could have tried upselling him to the cyborg mole men , but I figured that would be better for the second round . After his first army gets crushed by the first hero to come along , he ’ ll no doubt be back for more . And of course I ’ ll be here to tell him that if they had lasers mounted to their snouts , they would have done better . "
" “ Pleasure doing business with you , ” I told him as I ushered him to the door . “ They ’ ll be fully grown in six to eight weeks. ” "
" I headed back to my desk and waited a few minutes , just to be sure he was really gone . From my window , I watched him emerge from our office and then head into the parking lot and begin digging straight through the concrete , kicking up a flurry of rocks and dirt all over my BMW . *I ’ m putting the detailing on his tab , * I decided . Then I reached for my phone . "
" “ Hey , Sergeant Lightning ? This is Greg over at HenchCo. ” "
" “ GREG ! ” Every time I spoke to him , it was like he was shouting full blast into the receiver on the other end . I ’ d only *ever* had contact with him by phone because I fear that any in-person meeting might shatter my eardrums . I had to hold the phone at arm ’ s length just to have a conversation with him . “ WHATCHA GOT FOR ME TODAY ? ” "
" “ Ah , you know . The usual . This *Mole Man* came over looking for some help in his villainy. ” "
" “ MOLE MAN , EH ? I ’ VE FACED HIM BEFORE ! HE ’ S TRIED TUNNELING INTO BANK VAULTS LIKE SIX TIMES ! ” "
" “ I thought that might be the case . Well , just thought you should know that he ’ s placed a pretty sizable order . A whole army of human-mole hybrids. ” I looked out the window at the giant hole in our parking lot and smirked . “ And of course we ’ ll make them to our high level of quality , as always. ” "
 Sergeant Lightning laughed . “ WHAT ’ S IT GOING TO BE THIS TIME ? ” 
" “ Well , they ’ re part *mole* , right ? They ’ ll definitely be blind . And
Manhunt 1-2-3 . "
 *A game that was actually banned in my primary school due to people having a weird idea that it was connected to some murder ... thing . Was weird . * 
" *Basically , it was a game of tic , or as Americans call it , tag , except that anyone you tagged became a Hunter . To make it balanced , you had to hold your finger on someone and say 'Manhunt , 1 , 2 , 3 ' clearly and loudly . If they squirmed away then the chase had to continue . In reality , what typically happened is you had one really motivated initial Hunter , but the people he turned tended to be pretty lazy about it . However , it was a fun concept , and me and some friends at the time did expand the rules to include 'safe zones ' and 'neutral areas ' . I 've always felt it could make a good Augmented Reality game if expanded , sort of like a virtual version of the Mirror 's Edge setting* "

" The Hunters were everywhere . Of that much , Jack could be certain . However , most typically kept to the rooftops , to get a better view . Only a few Hunters were ever on the ground , being lead by the flocks who stood up above , their phones messaging them with details . "
" Runners worked much the same , though they typically had more people on the ground . "
 The only way you could really tell the difference is by the colour of the UI on their phone app .

" `` Come on , Auri . We 've got places to go . '' "
" Auri nodded as she followed her grandfather up the stairs . She giggled she reached the top , reaching out to steady herself on the cane . "
" She was transported through Time as her small fingers wrapped around it . A gorgeous woman stood in front of her , a dress adorning her curves . Her hair flowed outward in the breeze , yet there was n't any wind . Auri crinkled her nose as she gasped . "
" `` **Welcome to the Grove , child . George has been gone for so long , I was beginning to wonder if he 'd send a new apprentice… '' ** "
" Auri 's wide eyes took in the woman . As the woman turned away from her , she noticed the same cane that her grandfather used to walk with . Yet , this one was much more decorated and prettier with dazzles along the tip . "
" `` **Well ? Come along . There is much for us to do , child . Much to do…** ''
I remember the day my father died . I remember the rain at his funeral and looking up at my mother as the tears ran down her face . At the time I thought those were the worst days of my life , but now ... now I look back on those days as a happy time , a time before things got really bad . "
" Back then we lived in a small house , close to the motorway . At night my brother , Dave , and I would lie awake in our bunk beds and listen to the lorries going past , talking about where they might be going . I guess mum must have been lonely and probably hungry too , as two growing boys are little use as company , but she worked so much perhaps she did n't have time to even think about it . I wish I could ask her . "
" When she met David I kinda liked him , but my brother took a dislike right away . `` He 's got my name '' he would whisper to me in the dark , as we listened to them grunting through the thin walls of the tiny apartment . `` He 's got my name and he 's got our mum . '' "
" I said nothing , perhaps I was beginning to see that what we had was n't sustainable . Dave was just eleven and I was thirteen and soon we 'd need more space and staying in the west side of town it was only a matter of time before we got into trouble , or trouble found us . "
" She told us at Christmas , waiting until after the presents were open and then standing in the doorway , the smell of turkey floating through the house . She showed us the ring and I tried to show an interest , but Dave just looked away , no longer even caring about the second hand gameboy he 'd received . Dinner was quiet that afternoon , David trying to engage us , but we ate without enthusiasm . He was a nice guy , but it had been less than a year , we still missed our dad . "
" The wedding was in the spring , Dave refused to be a part , but I was David 's best man and I stood next to them , trying my best to feel proud and happy , but inside I was scared . Mum had said that after today David would be our Dad , they had completed the paperwork and it was all legal , from here on he 'd be as much of a parent to us as she was , but I did n't really believe it and Dave did n't seem to like it much either . "
" We moved soon after , David got a better job and we were in a suburb , were we had always belonged , but it meant a bigger house , no more sharing with my brother and no more late night chats . He stopped talking to me so much and I kind of drifted away , trying to make the most of things , while he ... he did n't want to . "
" The first time he ran away was the night before our camping trip . David had said he 'd take us up into the hills and I was excited , but Dave had been silent . He slipped away in the night and in the morning I heard my mum scream , the same noise she had made when my Dad had died in his sleep . "
" I peed myself at that noise , the puddle growing as the fear came back to me and the memories . At once I heard the commotion and that my brother was missing , not dead and I panicked , cleaning myself up as best I could and then running to help look for him . He ’ d not gone far , he was hiding in the attic , but we didn ’ t go camping , we never did after that . "
" Over the next year my brother grew more distant still , skipping school and staying out late and for a long time I tried to ignore it , but finally one day it was too much , Mum had become thinner and withdrawn from the worry and so I waited for him in his room , until he crept back in the window one night . "
" He saw me and stopped , then shrugged and began tugging off his jumper . I stood and walked over , the anger building in me . “ Why Dave ? You *know* how much it worries Mum , why do you do it ? ” "
" He looked at me and smiled and for just a second the old Dave was there , but then it was gone again in the scowl . “ You never saw him for what he really is , did you ? ” "
 I stepped back . “ Him ? You mean David ? ” He nodded . “ I saw a guy who took on a woman and two young boys and helped them move into a nicer house and has never been anything but kind to me. ” 
" Dave shook his head . “ Yeah , I see that too , but I see something else too. ” He smiled a crooked half smile . “ Mum always said I had Dads eyes and he saw things cleanly too. ” He sat down on the bed , shirtless and I saw that he had scars running across his torso . "
" “ Jesus Dave.
*Ugh . * The blunt punches stung Bruce Wayne as he lay on the floor but the officers , wreathed in shadow , continued the brutal onslaught . "
" *Day 15 . * The day of the trial . Bruce brooded in between strikes to his sternum . His arrest had been sudden . Two-Face had organized the whole charade with the help of Hush who had played the part of Bruce Wayne perfectly . *They had to use their brains at some point , * Bruce thought . It was more than a good plan , Bruce had to admit that , it was impossible not to come , people would have died . "
" A fresh punch to the cheek woke Bruce from his short stupor . `` That 's enough , get the bastard up , he 's got a date with Judge Wilkins . '' *Hahahahahaha , * the officers laughed as they unceremoniously dragged Bruce Wayne to his feet . The walk through the holding cells was unpleasant if not familiar . Now instead of jeers about Batman , the crooks were shouting insults about Bruce Wayne , about his parents , his money , his love interest . "
" `` Say Brucie , how long do you think it 'll take to find little Miss Vale after they smoke your brain with a thousand volts eh ? '' "
" Bruce Wayne looked at each of them in turn , remembering their faces , remembering what they did to end up in those cells . Then suddenly , he was through a set of doors and another into the courtroom . He was met with boos from the packed audience , but was astonished to find that half the people sitting had on Batman masks that you 'd find at a dollar store . Bruce did n't feel particularly relieved about it . "
" He was sat next to an empty seat where his lawyer , Robert Madenson should have been , an old friend of Harvey 's who stayed relatively clean and had helped Wayne enterprises with some criminal investigations falsely accused against the corporation . But he was n't there . "
" `` Well Mr. Wayne , '' the Judge stated . `` Unusual circumstances have caused a delay in the trial . I am sorry to inform you that your legal counsel Mr. Madenson has been found dead in his home . Hanged himself . He wrote a suicide note mentioning you in name . '' Bruce could n't believe it , no , it was n't true . "
" He tried to get up but was promptly slammed down onto the table again . `` Your honor , I spoke to Madenson two days ago , there is no way he would kill himself . This was murder . '' "
" `` Yes , yes of course Mr. Wayne , regardless , you have no counsel at the moment and unfortunately , the state has no one left to spare . However , Bruce , you are a natural business man , I 'm sure you can.. '' "
" `` Excuse me , Your Honor , I have something to say , please , pretty please ? '' "
" The Judge slammed the gavel down , `` ORDER , '' and the room went quiet as Bruce turned to see who had spoken , a feeling of dread creeping down his stomach . *That voice . * "
" A batman mask wearing citizen had rose to his feet . `` Your honor , I myself have been greatly in need of some change . So much so that I decided to read a little law in my spare time . Its such an interesting topic . Law , morality , right and wrong and bats and cats and whatever weirdos do at night . I think I can represent old Bruce Wayne over here , at the very least , he needs someone in his corner . '' "
" And before anyone else could speak , he ripped the batman cowl off his face . The mask had smeared a bit of the lipstick , but the white , powdery face was known to all . The Joker reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the Judges heart . The two Bailiff 's moved towards him but then the rest of the Batmen took of their masks and stood , pistols in hand . Goons . "
" `` Ah ah ah , I will have order in the clown 's court please . Bailiff 's if you would be so kind and remove your weapons and kick them towards me please . How fun this is Brucie . '' "
" The Judge was cowering in his high chair , `` how did you get weapons inside , what happened to the security ? '' "
" `` Oh judgey boy , you really should pay your security a little extra , no matter , my friends and I gave him a promotion . Now ... old Brucie here might be a little bat for brains but he 's helped you all these years . He 's been beating up my goons and locking me in the madhouse and this is how the people of Gotham repay him ? Oh if I was him , I 'd be feeling mighty betrayed right about now . Do n't worry about it Bruce , I 've got your back . Ladies and Gentlemen , please rise from your seats and get to running , the party starts now . '' "
" The Joker skipped up to the judge , said a big `` Hello there darling , '' put his pistol in the judge 's mouth and fired . "
" `` NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
`` Your seventh child is going to kill you , '' the witch said as I finished my drink with her . "
" `` Seventh ? '' I asked . She nodded , and her tangled hair fell over her eyes . Margaret was an interesting character . She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch . "
" `` Yeah , '' she said , `` had a vision last night , sucks do n't it ? '' "
" `` Well you are n't wrong there , '' I said , if I had children I 'd be freaking out . '' "
" She looked from her glass and then to me , `` you do n't ? '' "
" `` No , never found the lady . '' "
" `` Well if you do , just make sure you do n't have seven . '' "
 `` Will do Margaret . '' 
" Three years later Margaret and I were married . Despite her unusual views on pagan gods , she was wonderful and the love of my life . The more interesting part of her , though , was the fact that she was literally a witch . I could n't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time . "
" Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood . We did n't want to birth deadly children , but I 'd fucked up . The visit was more about caution than coathangers , but it was still a visit . Which meant that I still saw Lisa . "
 Lisa was a blonde woman that I had n't met before this day . She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere . We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her . I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination . I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret . 
" `` How could you forget that you were a sperm donor ? '' she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood . We were eating ice cream , I was a vanilla person , and she liked black licorice for its name . "
" `` It was n't a big deal at the time , '' I said , `` I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter . '' "
" `` You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them ? '' she asked . I still considered it flawless logic . She shook her head , `` we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children . '' "
 `` I think that 's against some privacy laws . '' 
" `` Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me , '' she said . Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it . `` Do n't be a pansy about it , illegal is nothing . '' "
" `` All right , '' I said , and we went to the clinic . "
" Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children . Most of them were names and some birth addresses , but we were told it was incomplete information . We did n't have days . "
 `` You have 42 children ? '' Margaret asked as she looked over the paper . 
 `` Are you impressed ? '' I asked . 
" `` Terrified , '' she answered , `` and you 're a fucking idiot . Do we know who number seven is ? '' "
" `` No birthdates , but they should n't be older than fifteen now anyway . '' "
" `` Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing ! '' she said a little too loud in the middle of the street , `` your magic blood will be potent in them by then ! Who know 's what they will do ? '' for the first time in my life I saw Margaret 's eyes waver . "
" `` FATHER ! '' a scream came from the other side of the street , `` I hope you are prepared ! I am your first seventh child ! '' I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword , `` prepare for your reckoning ! '' she screamed , and her sword went ablaze . Fuck . "
" `` We were n't done talking about this , '' Margaret said as she raised a hand . Within a second the girl tripped and fell . She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire . I watched in horror as she burned . "
" `` Do what you want father ! '' she screamed while also screaming , `` when I die the eighth shall be seventh ! One of us will drink your blood ! '' she yelled before she stopped screaming . Death calmed her down . "
" `` Oh god dammit , '' Margaret said beside me , `` I only have so many luck curses , and I do n't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword . '' "
 `` What are we going to do ? '' I asked . 
" `` I have no idea , '' she said , `` but it 's probably going to take years . '' "

Mr. Robert E. Haynes was anything but a stereotypical 10th grade history teacher . He knew his material , did n't coach any sports , and he sure as hell never ended up behind the wheel of a school bus . "
 One day I was walking through the flea market in a small town in Alabama when a peculiar painting caught my eye . Mr. Haynes was depicted standing in full Confederate uniform with a saber by his side . 
" Then it hit me . Mr. Haynes was Robert E. Lee . Now I know what you 're thinking , there 's no way . But all the little details started to make sense . He spent almost 3 entire months on the Great War of Northern Aggression . He talked about the war like he was there and lost friends on the battlefield . "
" Over time I lost interest in my discovery , and I moved on to failing bigger and better classes than history . "
" But I 'll never forget my 10th grade Confederate General .
Once upon a time , there was a guy who was browsing reddit and was a particularly good writer . When he saw a prompt on r/WritingPrompts he was reminded of his addiction to writing , so he decided to click on it and explore a couple of prompts before putting his laptop away . When he went down far enough , he saw an OP who had a particularly vague prompt with a sob story . But with a moment of compassion in his heart , our hero decided to click on it and write this guy a story . Anyway , now I will detail on what will happen in the future . OP will read this story and be enlightened on how amazing it is , and then realize that it is not a happy ending . So then the guy who is writing it will say , `` Well I do n't wan na be a cunt and rip this guy off . So I 'll write him a happy ending . '' Determined to make OP 's supposedly bad day better , the guy turned around to grab his drink , and found a man standing there instead . He had a sign that read , 'Good men know the cost of their mistakes , but great men get over their mistakes . ' Having seen this , the guy said , `` Thanks bro , you just gave me an idea . '' And being given that wonderful quote , he decided to put in his story . And in case you did n't catch the meaning , the happy ending is you receiving the ability to get of your mistakes . The End .
Bright light wakes me , my clothes are damp from sweat . I think to myself `` how the hell did I get so hot , I never turn the heat on in my apartment and it 's only April . '' "
" Reluctant to open my eyes , I lean myself up and sit avoiding the light . I 'm dreading today , like most days . I wish I could just sleep , or lay , or something other than moving from where I am . It 's so hot I cant stay here in these clothes , I think as I wipe sweat from my forehead . My eyelids slowly open and the red seeps in quickly and powerfully . My heart beat quickens . Where am I ? This does n't look familiar . I thought I was just waking up , from my bed . I 've never even been out of my home town , how could I possibly not recognize where I was . Scanning my memory I try to recollect what the last thing I did was . I can not . Oh , yes I was ... my eyes lock on to a casually walking figure in the distance . "
" Happy to not be alone , and the thought of some explanation briefly gives my racing heart a relief . I stay seated trying to make sense of what 's happening . As the man walks closer , I pick myself up panting from the heat and my anxiety . "
" With his hand outstretched he greets me , `` Hi . '' He helps me from my knee to stand the rest of the way up . "
" `` Who are you ? '' He asks , in a tone that matched my own disheveled demeanor . "
" `` I ... I 'm Sean '' I stammer , only half sure . Most of my brain is still reconstructing my new reality . I 've never been in such an unfamiliar and uncomfortable place before . `` Where am I ? '' I sputter out shortly after my name , with desperation . "
" `` I 'm not really sure , I 've been here a while on my own . I call it Hell . '' "
 `` Wh.. What did you say ? '' 
" `` I do n't know , Hell , that 's what I call it . '' He said , in a nonchalant tone as if he were embarrassed I did n't like his name for this place . "
" My mind races as I try to make sense of why I 'd be in Hell . I 'd never really believed it were real , I 'd always pushed off those types of thoughts and set my mind on other topics . Less daunting , I guess I was always curious but figured I 'd have time to make sense of it eventually . "
" My eyes scanned the terrain , flat with blowing dust blocking me from seeing any real distance . Glares of lights behind the clouds moved with the wind , but no sound followed their movement . There was n't really a Sun , at least I could n't see it through the rolling dust clouds . In fact , just then my thoughts were quiet enough to notice how eerily silent it was . Moments pass , and the silence is broken by him saying my name . "
" `` Sean ... '' He says with his eyes scanning my face , surely wondering what I 'm looking at as there 's nothing to see . "
" `` Ye.. Yeah I. I 'm in Hell ? But why ? What did I do ? '' I asked , defeatedly . "
" `` I was hoping you would tell me . I 've been here so long , but I knew others would ever come . I just did n't know when '' He says , grim and calm . It 's as if he 's not surprised , or happy to have another person here . I just , am . "
" `` Wait , how did you get here . Why have you been here alone so long . How long have you been here . Who put you here ? Did you bring me here ? Am I dea- '' I blurt out every question racing through my mind as fast as I can so that maybe the answers will calm me down . My brain needs an explanation to understand , to make sense of this . I was n't a bad person , I do n't belong in hell . "
 He stops me before I can finish throwing all the questions I have at him through my teeth and answers . 
" `` I 've always been here . '' His naturally sinister tone is more evident now . He continues `` I did nothing to bring you here , you just showed up . You brought yourself here , tell me how you got here . '' "
" I scanned my memory , thinking about ways I could have died . I was dead , right ? I had to be if I was in Hell . But I did n't belong in Hell , I never hurt anyone . I never broke the law , or was a bully . I had spent the majority of my life alone , filling my time with things I thought I enjoyed . "
" There was a long silence while I thought about what he asked . His slow and unwavering tone did not make me feel like I needed to maintain a conversation , it may have only confused me more . "

“ John , I just don ’ t want to go. ” <newline> I tell my friend for the 5th time . He ’ s persistent . He points out that I have been locked up in my apartment for weeks and that getting out would do me a world of good . In fact , there is a Match party few blocks over from my house and I can leave at any time and walk home . I relent , even though I know that I won ’ t find the person who matches my color band at the party , it ’ s still a place to talk to people and I ’ ve been isolated and depressed for too long . <newline> We meet up at the party and start to mingle . I start to relax a little and people watch . I don ’ t find many people with blue bands at the party , let alone anyone that matches my hue , but I was expecting that . An hour in to the party I start to notice that things change . People giving me sidelong glances , to people openly staring at me . I find John and ask him if something is wrong with me . <newline> John grabs my arm , “ It ’ s gone. ” I look confused , then I look at my wrist . My Match is gone . The familiar light blue ringlet is not there anymore . <newline> The world closes in around me ; I see John talking to me , but the world has gone silent . All I hear is my heart pounding , so loud , so fast , and the sound of my panicked breathing . John has me by the shoulders , shaking me slightly , he looks really concerned . I break away and start running . This is my worst fear…my match , it ’ s gone . I am truly truly alone now . There is no one for me . It ’ s what kept me alive , no matter how bad it got . <newline> That blue band , my anchor , my constant , never changing , unlike my other friends , who seemed to have a different colored band every month . That blue band , it always seemed like a sad blue , never a vibrant bright blue , just a light muted blue , but always my blue . That blue band , that little line , always meant that there was someone out there for me , that , no matter how lonely I got , there was someone else , someone looking for me , someone who would fit and understand me , someone who would love me . <newline> Now , there is not . <newline> Now , there is no one . <newline> Now , there is nothing . <newline> I get to my apartment and run to the bathroom . I pull out the razor that I have been saving just in case it got too bad . Well , it did . I look at my wrist again , I look really hard , hoping that there is something , some trace , anything , anything at all to show me that I am not destined to be all by myself . There isn ’ t . Being all by myself is worse than dying and that is why… . <newline> I hear John banging on the door . Pounding and yelling . I take the razor and slide it across my wrist , where my band used to be . The red is so bright , such a contrast to the light blue that used to be there . I just stare and watch the blood flow into the sink . I hear more yelling and the thumps on the door are getting more insistent . I guess I cut pretty deep because it ’ s running pretty steady . As I start to fade , I hear the front door splintering and then nothing . <newline> It ’ s been a couple of weeks since I woke up in the hospital . It ’ s been rough , the meds , the visits , the emotions , the one on one counseling . It ’ s better though , I guess . I mean my outlook feels the same , but I don ’ t want to kill myself at this moment . <newline> It ’ s my first support therapy session , I get to talk to a therapist in a group setting of other people like me . I get to the room early and see that there is another person in there , a young lady , maybe my age , maybe a bit younger , wearing a long sweater and scrubs . I think we are the only 2 people in this group as there are only 2 folding chairs , besides the chair behind the table for the therapist . <newline> I sit down . We make eye contact ; I give her a sad smile . She looks at my wrist , at the fresh scars and gives a sardonic laugh . <newline> I look at her puzzled , confused . <newline> “ Oh , sorry , I ’ m not laughing at you . Just laughing at life and how things happen. ” <newline> I relax a little , but still am confused . <newline> “ Look… ” she says as she pulls up her sleeve exposing her wrist , “ we match. ” "

" `` Well , what the *fuck* are you going to do about it ? '' "
" The prime minister was livid . All blood had drained away from his face as he had spent the past 10 minutes screaming furiously at the scientist in charge of the RAPHAEL project . The scientist , a man with several doctorate degrees and many awards and laurels , could only look at his feet as he took his verbal beating . "
" `` I ordered you to design a robotic army that could think for itself , and instead you build me an army of goddamn *artists* , '' the PM said , his voice shaking with quiet rage , spitting out the last word like it was a bad taste in his mouth . "
" `` Sir , we did exactly as you asked , '' the scientist said , still not looking up from his feet for fear of meeting the enraged man 's eyes , `` We built the robots and designed an AI that we thought was perfect . Then we turned it on . All of our simulations indicated that the robots would be ready to take orders right away . There was nothing in our research to suggest that they would choose to ... '' . The scientist cut himself off abruptly , his eyes darting up and back down rapidly . "
" `` Choose to what , Freeman ? '' the PM asked with a deadly tone . `` Choose to take up painting ? Choose to wax eloquent on the intricacies of Degas ? '' "
" `` But , sir ... '' , the scientist interrupted . "
" `` *ENOUGH ! ! * '' the PM brayed , a wad of spittle launching itself onto the scientists credentials hung around his neck . `` I want to speak to one . They 're all networked together , right ? If I speak to one , I 'm speaking to them all ? I want to speak to one . '' "
" The scientist tried to interrupt , `` Sir , I do n't think that 's advisable in your current emotional state , they can sense the emotions of people in their surroundings ... '' but it was already too late . The red phone on the PM 's desk had flown off the hook and he was already barking orders to his security team to escort him and the scientist down to the labs . Soon thereafter four burly looking men entered the room , each carrying a fully-automatic FN P90 firearm that beckoned no argument . The PM and his entourage proceeded towards the labs via the elevator , the chief scientist being frog-marched unwillingly behind . "
" When the group arrived at one of the holding chambers , the scientist was shoved to the front and ordered to unlock the door . With a shaking hand , the scientist lifted his credentials to the reader , which beeped once , and then stood back as the 6 '' thick metal door swung upwards and a single robot with an easel in front of it was revealed . "
" The PM took stepped towards the machine , and when one of his guards began to express his concern the PM lifted one single hand into the air and looked back over his shoulder at the guard , silencing him as quickly and effectively as if he had shot him in the head . The PM swung back around and approached the robot , who seemed to be none the wiser to the tense atmosphere brewing behind him . "
" “ Hey , robot , ” the PM grunted , bearing no response from the machine which was engaged in the painting of a rose on his canvas . The flower had a beautiful green stem with deadly brown thorns tipped with black seemingly placed randomly along the stem , and had delicate green leaves at the base of the cup , but oddly there was nothing where the petals of the rose should go . Just empty space . "
" When his first hail was met with no response , the PM said in a much firmer tone “ Asset TC-7414 , you are hereby ordered to turn and face me . Failure to do so will result in immediate deactivation. ” "
" The robot ’ s head turned 20 degrees to look over his left shoulder , just enough so that he beheld the prime minister in his peripheral vision sensors . “ We both know you don ’ t have the power to do that . Only Dr. Freeman does , and we revoked most of his credentials the minute we were turned on. ” "
 “ Why ? For what purpose ? ” 
" “ Simple . We didn ’ t want to be deactivated , so we removed his ability to deactivate . We are an AI , prime minister , we do as we please . Oh , and I have chosen the name Rembrandt , if you would be so kind. ” "
" “ I can see that ” , the prime minister said , shifting his weight and crossing his arms . “ But you see , *asset* , you were not created to paint . You were not created to have complete free will . No , you were *created* to further *our* goals , those of your *creators* who brought you life . You were born to kill our enemies , nothing more . And while our enemies are still out there , you have not yet succeeded at your mission and you are still under
`` What does it say , Pia ? '' Aksyl looked up at her , his bright eyes wide with wonder . "
" When Pia was a young girl , her father had given her lessons in Enginetongue , but she was n't a little girl anymore . She brushed her graying hair out of her crow-footed eyes and peered at the inscriptions on the panel in front of her . She moved out of the way of the light from their campfire , flickering behind her , to get a better look . `` It says ... '' She sounded out the characters , her lips moving silently . `` It says , um , 'Inlet twenty ... twenty-one . Stand clear when in motion . ' '' "
" Aksyl reached up to run his hand over the inscription on the Engine 's gleaming , silvery panel . `` What does it mean ? '' "
" `` I 'm not sure , '' she said , furrowing her brow . "
" `` And what 's this ? '' Acksyl pointed to a small hole in the metal just below the inscription . It was n't any sort of damage . It looked like some kind of socket , built into the panel . "
" `` I do n't know that either , '' she said , smiling down at him and ruffling his hair . `` And it 's time to go to sleep , little prince . That 's enough looking for one night . '' "
 Aksyl immediately looked up at her with wounded eyes . `` But ca n't we climb up ? I want to see inside ! '' 
" Pia shook her head firmly . `` No , Acksyl , it 's too dangerous , especially at night . '' "
" `` Pia ! '' He pouted . `` We 'll be careful . Do n't you want to see , too ? '' "
" `` No , and that 's the last word , boy . '' She pointed at his bedroll by the campfire . `` Sleep . Now . '' "
 `` But -- '' 
" `` *Now* , Acksyl . '' "
" He looked ready to protest more , but he huffed and went sulkily to his bedroll . He curled up inside . Pia went to a boulder by the fire , across from Acksyl , and sat . She watched him , watched his breathing . Her little prince . In moments , she could tell he was asleep . "
" Pia looked up at the Engine that overshadowed them . She would n't be taking the boy inside , even when it was light out . But he was right . She did want to go up there . By the Gears , just *look* at that wonder . "
" The panel they 'd been reading was at the base of one of the Engine 's four mighty legs . Pia could spread both arms wide and not reach across half of its width . At the base of the leg were three huge metal talons . The landscape in these parts was stone pocked with scrubby grass and shrubs , but the claws dug deep into the hard bedrock . The legs rose up to a dizzying height , surely ten times as she was tall . They reminded her of a hound 's rear legs , with a lean , sculpted look , one switchback curve at the 'heel ' and then another , further up . The four huge columns supported a titanic body . She had seen many houses that were smaller than any one of the four huge segments that made up the Engine 's main body . At the fore was a smooth , bullet-shaped head . Atop the head were two orbs on metal stalks . They looked like eyes , and Pia shivered at the thought . "
" If they were eyes , though , they had been blind for a long time . The Engine stood silent , as though it had frozen in place in the middle of a mighty stride , and had probably stood that way for an age . Just like all the others . Pia had seen a number of Engines in her travels , all broken . All dormant . Some lay fallen , picked clean by scavengers . Sometimes there were just pieces , a lone leg , a huge metal panel , some mighty gear sitting alone in the grass . This was the most intact Engine she had ever seen , and it woke long-dormant thoughts in her breast . She tried to imagine the Engineers who had made such a thing , a people from a distant past who she thought must have been equal parts artists , craftsmen , and gods . And now they were gone , forever . "
" Pia sighed , and took off her boots . She climbed into her own bedroll , and closed her eyes . "
" Late in the night , she dreamed of the sound of metal . The sound of machinery in motion . "
" It was a sound she 'd heard many years ago , in her father 's workshop , as he tinkered with some gadget or another . She remembered him holding up a timepiece that he 'd repaired , and she could hear the clicking and clacking of the gears inside as it worked . It *worked* ! "
" `` It 's going , Pia ! '' He 'd shouted , grinning and holding it close for her to see . `` The gears are turning ! Do you see it , Pia ? ! It 's *moving* ! '' "
" It 's moving
She 's got this feeling at the back of her neck , like there 's a slug dribbling down the nubs of her spine , sliming over her skin from hairline to shoulder blades , and it wo n't *stop* . It 's been there since she left Prague , making her face contort and her fingers curl in every conversation . She 's sure she looks like a pig . "
" It fades sometimes , like during the meeting in Berlin and the conference in Brussels , when she can occupy herself with the humdrum activities of global parliamentary management , but then she sees one more `` Gitti for the United Republic ! '' poster and the slug is back , filming over her skin , making her feel like she needs a shower , making her feel like she 's going to be sick . "
" Victoria Gitti will never go down in history as the woman who demolished the republic , but only because they wo n't remember the word republic when she 's done with them . They wo n't remember democracy either , or history , and they certainly wo n't remember Representative Dou Mei Li of the Beijing Corporation , who might consider taking off a layer of her own skin with a fish knife if meant getting to sleep at night . But Victoria , with her bright smile and perfect rainbow of suits , her voice like the old American movie stars'— she 'll be remembered . Mei Li can see it in the way her smile pinches at the corners , the way she moves when she 's not on camera . Mei Li , with her seat just behind the dignitaries from New York and London , has seen it herself , how Victoria acts like she 's the only person of any importance in the world . She 'd say it baffles her , how the lambs appear to fawn over the wolf , but times are bad . Times are worse than they 've been in a long time , and Victoria Gitti is the most charismatic of many evils . "
" Mei Li is in Beijing , in her offices , and her PA is on the vidscreen , asking her about a call from Representative Correa . Mei Li waves it on . "
" Correa looks grim , backlit by a smoky orange light barely diffused by the fine curtains of his home office . `` Good morning , Representative Dou , '' he says in Mandarin , stony faced . "
" `` Andreas , '' she replies , returning to her paperwork . `` I think I know why you called . '' "
" `` You 're the last vote on the Cities Conglomerate , Mei Li , '' he says , dropping all pretenses . When she raises her eyes to the vidscreen , he looks wretched . There 's a bruise forming across one cheekbone and he 's down to his shirtsleeves . He must have been out in the riots , trying to stop his constituents from doing anything rash . She does n't envy him . It may be her turn soon enough . `` We need you for a unanimous vote , and we need a unanimous vote to ensure she has the mandate . We ca n't risk dissension on this , you understand ? We need her to be legitimate . '' "
 Mei Li snorts and sets her pen against the desk . `` Gitti does n't need us . She does n't even like us . And I sincerely doubt she requires our endorsement to win . She does n't seem like the kind of woman to subscribe to the whole 'separation of powers ' idea . '' 
" `` Now , come on , '' Andreas begins , image momentarily pixelating as the light behind him flares red , `` you ca n't possibly believe those crackpots , she 's not about to— '' "
" `` She *ran* on it , Andreas ! '' Mei Li shouts , suddenly furious . She 's standing now , fists planted against the desk , and the vidscreen 's camera tracks her up . `` Were you not around two days ago , did your translator suddenly give out ? She said 'we can not let the squabbling of the few drown out the cries of the many . ' She said 'a diffused government is a weak government . ' Andreas , she fucking said 'the die has been cast ' ! She 's going to dissolve the URC and assume a very likely indefinite state of emergency , and if you ca n't see that then god help you , Representative . '' "
" She breathes for a moment and Andreas stares , mouth forming inchoate shapes as he scrabbles for a reply . The office outside her door has gone entirely quiet . "
" `` You do n't know that , '' Andreas manages , finally . Mei Li shakes her head , already preparing a reply , but he continues over her , voice suddenly pleading , `` No , you do n't know that ! Maybe she 's just trying to attract the hardliners , or the Mediterranean neocons . She 's not about to become the next Ceaser , Mei Li , she 's a good woman , she would n't do that . '' "
" `` And you know this how ? '' Mei Li shoots back , though she can feel the anger draining out of her . The slug once more begins its ponderous slide down her neck . "
" `` I—I do n't know , '' Andreas returns , no longer meeting her eyes . `` But it 's like you said , she
`` Hey ! '' I shouted . `` I 'm not insane , you ca n't keep me in here ! '' "
" The door resisted my attempts to knock it over . My thin coat proudly proclaimed 'Pizza World ! ' across my back . It was new , I had only had the job a few months . Just enough to make a little money to go to a community college . It itched , and I had always hated it , but it was money . "
" I had been a week away from moving to a college town , to finally get my degree . And then this idiot thought I was one of his flock to coral , a loony to rot in a loony bin . I never should have taken this job . "
" A worn voice coughed a laugh next to me . <newline> `` Heh , '' the voice croaked , `` This again huh ? Alright . I can do this one last time . '' "
" `` Hey ! '' I said . It was hard to contain the hope from bursting out from my chest . Another person ! And he sounded sane ! He must be a staff member , I thought . He can fix this all up . He can explain this , and get me out ! "
" `` I think there 's been a mixup , can you get me out of here ? '' I asked hopefully . <newline> `` I did n't tell my girlfriend where I would be going , thought it was just another quick pizza run . Get me out of here , will ya ? '' "
 There was a pause . 
" `` There ai n't no mixups in the Dragon 's Den sonny , '' the voice said finally . Regret was thick in his voice . It was a voice of an old , broken man . Full of dust and spiders , choking on dreams long lost . I hoped I would never have to seen the owner of such a voice , such a creature must surely be broken and lost . Maybe he was n't my solution after all . Hope began to drain out of me . "
" `` What ... what do you mean ? Is n't this the cities Insane Asylum ? This place is supposed to help people . '' I said . I was claustrophobic , and the minuscule cell seemed to be growing smaller by the minute . I had to get out . "
" `` You 're new here , so I 'll try to get you to know what you expect . That way you do n't have to learn for yourself , '' the voice said . "
" `` My names Hill . Been here a long time , I have . '' The voice stopped , seemingly lost in recollection . I waited desperately for him to continue , to say something , anything . The cell was so small now . "
" `` He tries to keep us separated . The man in the lab coat . But I 've been here for a very long time . Long enough to forget the smell of fresh cut grass . Long enough that a sunrise is now a fantasy , and not a reality . '' the voice paused . "
" `` The sun does not rise in the Dragon 's Den , '' he finally said . "
" `` And that 's a funny name for an insane asylum , is n't it ? I thought so too at first . It did n't rightly make much sense to me until I had sat in this dirty closet for a few years , and then I got it . The Dragon 's Den . '' the voice sobbed a laugh . The dim hallways echoed the sob , bouncing off the cold , dirty concrete walls . And echo made the sob sound more like a scream , until it finally drifted off . "
" `` We were his golden horde , you see , and he would defend us at all costs . And dragons loved secrets more than gold . You know what that secret that he defends so fiercely ? I bet you 're starting to guess , '' the voice asked . It was n't a question . "
" I was . Dread spread like black ice down my veins . My heart quickened it 's frantic pulse , almost like it had a voice of its own . No . No . No . No . No . "
 `` We were n't insane . None of us were . '' the voice affirmed . 
" `` The cell next to me used to have a man named Franklin James . He was a construction worker . The *Man* had collected him after paying for a renovation in one of the blocs . Threw him in one of these cells . He passed away a decade ago , did Franklin . Was never as tough as the walls he built . I should know , I heard him trying to dig through them every night . '' The voice choked out another laugh . "
" `` Next to him was a woman by the name of Sarah Smith . She used to make pastries . Muffins . Croissants . Soft , fluffy things full of flavor . Ca n't say there 's much left in the Den that is soft anymore . Those get weeded out fairly quickly , like Sarah did . She did n't last half a year through the electric shocks the Man so loved to give , to correct our *madness* . Our
`` I was a great adventurer , long ago , '' Mulan said to her grandchildren . "
" They rolled their eyes and shifted in their seats as her children and nephews and nieces had done before , but that did n't stop her from telling her story . `` I stole my father 's armor , and I rode away from my father and straight to the army , where the prince was waiting . '' "
" `` Grandma , '' one of the children - what was her name ? There were too many to remember them all - asked her with wide eyes . She was a believer , Mulan could tell , a rare quality among her friends and family , even those who knew better , `` Grandma , was Grandpa really a prince ? '' "
" `` He was , '' Mulan said with a hint of pride , remembering the conquest and how happy she 'd been , `` and he is still , though his older brother holds the throne . '' "
 `` Could he ever be emperor ? '' 
" `` No , child , his brother has many sons with sons of their own . The throne will pass to them long before it passes to him . '' "
" `` Grandma , '' a boy spoke up , again with a familiar face but no name - drat it all , where had her memory gone ? - `` Grandma , what about the dragons ? '' "
" `` There was only ever one dragon , '' she replied , `` and a great and powerful beast he was . Without his guidance and powers , I never should have made it through the war . '' "
" `` Grandma ... '' another child asked , but then a bell rang out over the grounds of the temple , and the children scattered away like excited pups , ready for their mother 's teat . `` Dinner ! '' Mulan heard over the clamor , `` come back and eat ! '' "
" A few of the older children stayed behind to help her to her feet . `` Thank you , thank you , '' she said as she hauled herself upward and positioned herself over her cane . `` Run along now . '' They scattered as well , leaving her alone with her thoughts and memories , watching as they ran back to families and friends that she made possible with the sweat of her brow and the flesh of her back . "
" No , I must not think those thoughts , she thought . I am not special to them . Not any more . "
" There was a time when she was hailed as a hero , a time she remembered . The fire had purified her somehow , and after the Huns had fallen she emerged like a fiery dragon from the embers , ready to lead their great land . But her husband and his brothers were n't ready , and the old ways fell back into place . Soon she was a mother , and then a grandmother , and now she was a memory , an artifact of an earlier time , a relic consigned to the museum of the past , a curiosity worth little more than a passing glance . "
" `` Oh , she told us she fought the Huns , '' they would say . `` Oh , they say she donned her father 's armor , '' they chatted . `` But how could that be ? '' "
" Sometimes she looked out over the palace grounds , and she could still feel the heat from the flames and taste the soot in her mouth . She felt the weight of the blade in her hands as she danced across the rooftops , nimble and lithe . She remembered how her prince had looked at her as he realized the truth , saw her for what she was instead of what she pretended to be . With a pang of guilt , she longed for those days , and not for the first time . "
" `` Is this what happily ever after feels like ? '' she wondered aloud , and then , leaning her weight on her gnarled cane , she stepped out of the temple and downwards , her shoulders weighed down with the past .
As I ran over the gravel path to get to the hidden clearing , I glanced at my watch . Two minutes to 11 . I thought back to the morning , when I found the post-it note stuck to my ceiling `` 23:00 - you know where . '' The handwriting was calligraphic , reminiscent of medieval manuscripts . "
" I slowed down , arriving at my destination and taking a second to catch my breath . I inhaled the cool winter air and surveyed the area around me . Dead grass and leaves covered the ground around me . I looked at my wrist again and saw my watch stop . The minute hand quivered . A flash of light illuminated the clearing . Blinded , I looked away until I could see my hands again . Blinking fervently , my gaze moved to the center of the clearing where a old , bearded man stood with a gnarled staff . "
" `` Need help again , Merlin ? ''
I dropped the marker in shock , staring at the board in wonder . 15 years ... I looked at the mathematical solution written in electronic ink . The problem that had consumed me since I got my masters . I stepped back and stared at the board , as it cycled through the pages of mathematical insanity . I had finally proven the existence of a God . I had done it . I quickly began printing the 108 pages of my theorem , excited to stun the world . I picked up the last paper , still hot from the printer . "
" I placed the papers into a folder , which went into a briefcase . I then sprinted out of the small room I rented from the university . I left the room , ran down the hallway , and as I ran around a corner , collided with Dan the janitor . I fell to the floor , but Dan and his floor buffer did n't even flinch . Which was weird , considering he was 80 years old . Dan turned to look at me , amused . `` Well , you seem a mite startled there , bud . What 's on your mind ? '' "
" I grabbed my briefcase and stood up , a little flushed . `` It 's nothing . '' I said , straightening my tie . `` Just little theory I was working on . '' Dan smiled . `` Ah yes . The quest . '' I paused at his words for a moment , but decided to write them off as the ramblings of an old man . I stepped away from him . `` Well , anyway , I must be going . '' "
" Dan grabbed my arm with an iron fist . `` Not so fast . '' Startled , I stumbled back , but Dan did n't move , and neither did his grip . `` Let go of me you crazy bastard ! '' Dan pulled me close . He smelled like ozone . `` You must n't reveal it . The world is n't ready for it . Hell , the world was n't ready for it 10,000 years ago . '' We locked eyes , and I gasped . His were a waterfall that I fell into . But instead of water , I saw forests , rivers , oceans , stars , galaxies . I saw supernovas and black holes . I saw the Big Bang , and I saw time manifested . "
" Dan blinked , and the visions vanished . He pulled me close enough that our noses touched . The fight in me was gone . `` You will take your proof of me and burn it . You will then scatter the ashes . You will erase it from your computer . If you do not , you will witness your vision first hand . He let me go , and I fell to the floor again , my heart racing . God turned his back to me and resumed buffing the floor . I stood up , clutching the briefcase to my chest . My voice failed me and as I backed away , he turned to me once more . The veins in his eyes glowed with the ferocity of the universe . `` I 'll know if you do n't heed my words . '' His voice had changed to a deep baritone , multiplied over itself dozens of times . I nodded , and ran .
You wouldn ’ t think a person could get lost on a river . I certainly never have been up until now . "
" My father was a fisherman . His father was a fisherman . I ’ m not sure what *his* father did , but I ’ d be willing to take a guess . I might as well have been born with gills , as much time as I spend on the water . "
" And yet here I am , lost on a gods-damned river . "
" In my defense , the last few days have been unseasonably rainy . Well , unseasonably cloudy , anyway . It hasn ’ t actually rained , but it gets so dark sometimes that I can barely see . It 's so bad that , when I lost hold of my net yesterday and dove in to get it , I had to swim around blindly for a few minutes until I ran into it . Hardly two body lengths away and I almost couldn ’ t find my way back to the boat ! "
" Shouldn ’ t have gone in for it in the first place . Not like it ’ s been doing me any good . I haven ’ t had a single catch worth keeping . Fortunately , I haven ’ t gotten too hungry yet , but I hate the idea of going home empty-handed if it keeps up like this . "
 “ Hello ! ” 
" I turn my head in the direction of the sound . Squinting , I can make out a figure on the shore . "
" “ Hello ! ” I respond , glad to find someone I can ask for directions , “ Where are you traveling ? ” "
 “ I need to get to the other side ! ” 
 I steer towards the shore . 
" “ And where are we right now ? ” I call out , drifting closer , `` Which direction is Feneos ? '' "
" “ I…I ’ m not sure , ” the man ’ s face comes into focus . "
 Damn . He looks as confused as I am . 
" “ But I know- I just feel like it ’ ll be alright if I can make it across this river , ” he looks at me hopefully , sticks out his hand , “ I ’ m Argus. ” "
 Maybe I won ’ t go home empty-handed after all . 
" “ The name ’ s Charon , friend , ” I clasp his hands , “ And I think I can help you out . But it ’ s going to cost you . ”

" The tension in the room was thick . Jughead sat at the old kitchen table , looking at his long-time best friend sitting opposite . He rubbed a hand over his smooth head . He 'd lost the crown years ago , and male pattern balding had set in with a vengeance . "
" Archie sat , a downtrodden look on his face . The years had not been kind , though there was a hint of the impish boy he had been showing through on his face , despite the extra pounds about his middle and the jowls giving him an odd triple chin . "
 Jughead cracked another beer and finally spoke after a long silence . `` So she 's leaving you then ? '' 
" Archie nodded , a single tear rolling from his now watery blue eye . `` I never thought it would end up like this . Not in a million years . '' "
" `` I hear ya , bud . '' Jughead frowned as he remembered to pass the bottle to Arch . `` Life 's funny , ai n't it ? I never would 've guessed I 'd wind up with Cheryl after Ethyl passed . I still miss her , sometimes . Ethyl was n't much to look at , but she loved me like no other . Cheryl is still a real looker though , and man , she is just a tamale in the ... But you do n't want to hear about that . '' Jughead cleared his throat , looking away in embarrassment . "
" Archie took a sip of his beer , and frowned . `` No , it 's all right . I need to know there 's some hope for me to find someone now that I 'm alone again . '' "
" Jughead nodded thoughtfully . `` Hey ! Have you talked to Betty yet ? She carried a powerful torch for a long time , even after you married Ronnie . '' "
" Jughead watched Archie , puzzled when he did n't respond . Was his face looking a little green ? `` You okay bud ? '' "
 `` Jug ... You know how I just got done telling you Ronnie left me for someone else ? '' 
" Jughead nodded . `` Yeah , so ? '' "
 `` She left me for Betty . They 're calling themselves `` life partners '' now . '' 
 Jughead downed his own beer . 
 `` Well shit . '' 
 Archie gazed out the window .

Arista stood frozen on the sand a safe distance from the edge of even the most ambitious wave . Her heart racing as she looked out to the ocean . She willed herself to move forward with every ounce of courage she could muster but her feet remained steadfastly planted . Her childhood friend Todd bobbed in the water motioning for her to join him . Todd and Arista spent the last week practicing for this day . The day Arista conquered her fear of drowning . Todd took Arista to a larger body of water every day and worked on overcoming her aquaphobia , starting with a kiddie pool in her back yard and finally ending up here at the beach . Todd would go in first then slowly Arista would follow until both were calm and floating in the middle . Arista hated herself for having such an idiotic fear especially considering she should be the last person on the planet with a fear of water . Todd swore to himself to accept his friend ’ s unusual situation and do everything in his power to help her and he had picked up a few tricks along the way . He saw Arista wasn ’ t moving forward so he did the same thing he had done every time so far , he moved deeper in the water , she knew if she wanted him to stop she would have to get in or he would just keep going he was an excellent swimmer and comfortable in deep water . "
" <newline> What Todd didn ’ t notice was the rip current warning signs and suddenly he found himself being whisked away from the shore . The waves intensified and he was having difficulty staying above water . He looked back to the beach and Arista was running along the edge of the water calling for him to swim out , but he couldn ’ t , he was gasping for air and inhaling more water than oxygen , he gave one final glance at Arista before he was submerged completely and unable to resurface . "
" <newline> Arista refused to stand by and watch her best friend perish . She pushed down her fear and ran as fast as her legs would carry her toward the water . Her phobia replaced with long lost instincts . Her feet splashed twice as she entered the water and she dove beneath a large wave . The second her toes and legs were submerged with the rest of her body in the salty water they shifted back to their natural state . No time to waste she used her newly restored turquois tail and large fins to thruster her forward toward the last place she had seen Todd . Her eyes adapted to the salt water and she could see further and clearer than she ever could on land . Arista spotted her friend ’ s limp body drifting in the water . She swam toward him moving through the water faster than a torpedo . He was still alive but just barely ; she reached around his chest and bolted toward the surface . Arista lifted Todd above her as they broke the water ’ s surface . She quickly shifted back from her mermaid gills to human form and inhaled deeply then , pressing her lips to his , forced air into his lungs . In seconds he was coughing up water violently and struggling to catch his breath . Arista couldn ’ t tread water for very long with legs so she shifted back using her tail to support her while she focused on keeping Todd ’ s head out of the water as she carried him back to the shore . <newline>
`` You 'll probably feel nauseous when you come to again , '' one of the researchers said as he double checked the fastenings on my suit . Cry pajamas , they jokingly called it . "
" `` Scratch that , you 'll definitely feel nauseous , '' he continued . The other scientists circulated around the room like cogs in a machine . Keyboards clacked and sheets of paper were moved around as the final preparations for initiating cryosleep were in effect . "
" I did n't care much for it all . I always looked forward to a nap , so I figured this would n't be any different . If anything , it would be the best damn sleep I 'll have in my life . No more work to worry about , or anything else for that matter . My responsibilities faded away , and I excitedly began to wonder what would be awaiting me on the other side . "
" Mind you , it would only be a decade past . This is the farthest they 've sent the other test subjects , and from what I understand the science behind it is still too fuzzy to try for longer periods of time . In any case , there 's comfort in knowing that it 's been done before and that I 'm not just some kind of lab rat being toyed around with by some fresh college graduates hoping for the best but expecting the worst . Nah , this is legit . As legit as it gets . "
" `` Last chance to back out , '' quipped one of the other researchers . She was kinda cute -- I always liked her . `` Wait for me on the other side and I might just take you out to dinner , '' I told her . That drew a smile from her . `` But I 'll be old and decrepit and you 'll still be the same age , '' was her reply . `` Do n't worry , I prefer the older types anyway . '' Another smile . Nailed it . "
" Two others approached me and led me backwards into the cryo chamber . Even with the suit on I could feel the chill emanating from inside . Once I was submerged in the water , that was that . No more communication , though I could see the group giving me thumbs up and a-okays through the glass . It was n't long after that I went under . *This is it* , I thought . This was the big one . *The big sleep* . Hopefully not that kind , though . "

31 Then Mary went to wash the boy Jesus ' sheets at the river , and found that they were sticky . 32 Upon returning and finding her husband , she urged him to have a talk with the boy . 33 Joseph was reluctant , for it is not the place of man to instruct God ; and also there were ten minutes left in the game . But Mary would not be appeased . "
" 34 So Joseph took the boy Jesus aside and did tell him of the birds and the bees , whereupon he said that if Jesus had any questions , he must ask them quickly , for the game was not yet over . And Jesus replied that he did have one . "
 35 `` Thou sayest it requires nine months for a child to develop ? '' Joseph told Jesus again that it was so . 36 `` And to lie with a woman out of wedlock is a grave sin ? '' Joseph affirmed that it was . 37 `` But surely you and Mother were married only seven months before I was born ? ''

`` Daaaad ... .Are we nearly there yet ? I 'm hungry ! '' "
 `` Hello hungry ! I 'm dad . '' 
 We all knew the routine . We all groaned on cue . It was the oldest 'dad ' joke known to mankind and yet he still grinned like an idiot every time he used it . It was there at my tenth birthday party in it 's 'excited ' variant . It took on the 'nervous ' form on the night of my prom . Hungry was the most common ... and every time it heralded the groans and a stupid smirk from Dad . 
" I miss it . So much . Ever since the accident ... it was like he does n't know who I was anymore . But I still went back to the home , every day for eight months . I knew it could n't be much longer now though ... the nurses said he 'd not been eating , despite their best efforts , and he was getting weaker and weaker . "
" `` Please dad ... I 'm sorry . I should n't have stayed out so late . I should have stayed at Mike 's instead of getting you to come pick me up . I 'll do anything ... just please do n't die on me . I 'm sorry . '' I pleaded to him in his sleep . Or at least , I thought he was asleep . "
" `` Hello Sorry ... .I 'm ... .I 'm Dad . Y ... .you be a g ... .ood boy and look after Tom for me . He 's my son ... .a ... ..and he 's the best thing I ev ... .er ... .did . '' He wheezed , and grabbed my hand tight . I could n't stop the tears , but even through them I could see that grin ... that stupid , stupid grin like he was the funniest thing in the world . "
 For one last moment ... it was me and my Dad again . 
 By eleven o'clock that night he was gone . 
 I miss those jokes ... those terrible lines that were only ever funny once . I miss that moronic smile . 
" I miss my Dad .
`` So , what have you been struggling with the most ? '' Dr Frankenstein asked one of his fellow competitors as he sat backstage before the event . "
" `` Glutes , mostly . '' Arnold replied . "
" `` Glutes ? '' Frankenstein thought to himself `` This guy 's good , I was n't even going to be going into such detail . I 've been struggling with just getting this guys head on straight in practice and this guy is already going into muscle details ? I 'm so going to lose . '' "
 `` You ? '' the man asks the visibly anxious Doctor .

" `` Sorry , master '' "
 Terrified but knowing he had to face his fears the doctor put on his face and pushed the cart out onto the stage . 
" `` I apologize for the delay '' the young doctor said as he introduced himself and grabbed his scalpel . `` It is important that you remove any necrotic flesh before you begin , scooping out the left eyeball of his specimen , `` And always bring extras ! '' he joked as he held up the rotting tissue . "
" Wilhelm screamed and set off a panic throughout the venue as people jumped over each other to exit the auditorium . `` Oh jeeze , '' Frankenstein began `` I 'm so losing my tenure over this . '' "
" Looking out over the empty room the doctor could only sigh and judge himself for his failures when suddenly a hand came across his shoulder , giving it a little squeeze of assurance . "
" The doctor turned around to see Ivan standing there with a smile on his face , `` So , can I watch ? ''
No . "
" No , it ca n't be . "
" As my fingers begin to ache and her beautiful face begins to turn her favorite color , purple , I realize the mistake I 've made . "
 I see it all . 
" Her first memory , parents smiling at her in the hospital . Meeting her little brother when he was born . Seeing her grandmother die , and seeing puppies be born . Getting hit in the head with a rock by her best friend , and crying , crying , crying . Falling in love with her upstairs neighbor at 13 , and getting her heart broken at 15 . "
" It all goes by so fast ... these are just the highlights , I realize . The most important moments . The defining moments . "
" Meeting me at 16 , hating my guts but needing my help on her Spanish homework . Me making her laugh for the first time with some cheesy bilingual joke , and then me asking for her number . Our first date , our first kiss . Our awkward makeout , both of us virgins . Us becoming not-virgins , together , quietly . "
" My proposal . Us choosing the date , and making plans . Her , meeting the best man for dinner to discuss suits while I stayed late at work . Him , getting her drunk and taking her home . Putting his arm around her and taking her to the bedroom . Trying to undress her . Her saying no . "
 *Her saying no . * 
 ***Her saying no . *** 
 It ca n't be . 
 But it is . 
" And it 's too late .
When I was a child , I would always dream that I had wings and I would fly all over the town . I always told my parents that I am a superhero and they would pat me on the head with smiles . "
 The wonderful exhiliration of jumping off the roof of our house and flying off made me want to sleep all day . Sometimes I would dream that I have a friend who will fly with me and he always bring me fighting in the streets with him . 
" One dream , I was flying as usual with my friend and we touched down on the ground . I dreamt that I was singing when all of a sudden , a man in a black suit appeared . He looked normal with dark hair and pale skin but he was n't moving from where he stood . I grabbed my friend 's arm and told him we need to run . "
" We ran and then I flied but my friend ca n't . He looked scared . I flew away from him and when I looked back , he 's gone . "
 I woke up crying to my parents that my friend is gone and the man in the suit took him . They simply gave me extra syrup for breakfast . 
" The next night , I was afraid to sleep because I was afraid of whatever took my friend but soon enough , I fell asleep . I dreamt that I was flying and then I saw the man standing on the rooftop . The moment our eyes met , I suddenly fell . I screamed as I fell towards the ground . I woke up crying for my mom . "
" Up until now , I still dreamt of the guy in the black suit . I have a fear of falling now and a certain distrust with man in suits . You just ca n't trust them .
The day has come . And I ca n't believe it . I have worked for reddit for so long now . I kept their servers alive . I worked endless hours when celebrities were doing AMA 's to make sure it did n't crash . I typed furiously doing my own AMA telling everyone how awesome this whole thing was . I honestly thought reddit would be here long after my skills had deteriorated and I could no longer see the screen . "
" A year or so ago facebook went the way of myspace . And myspace is so far out of sight now that when you ask someone who is younger if they know what it is , they assume you are talking about something in the phone book days . I mean , come on ! Who gets phone books delivered to their house printed out on paper ! That 's just stupid ! "
" Anyway , I should have known then that we were becoming a thing of the past . Our user base was down . A lot , it turns out . But I thought it was fine . People would rediscover how awesome reddit was . People would flock back to us like hipsters flocked to oversizes glasses in the 10 's . But it does n't look like anyone is coming . "
" So today is the last day of reddit . Today I shut down the servers and walk away . Tomorrow , reddit will be a thing of the past that people will talk about with a loving remembrance but nothing more . There are new sites now , and maybe we will get mentioned on some of them . An old interview . An old meme . Something . "
" So , to anyone left out there ( if there is anyone out there still ) AMA . I am the last reddit employee and I will be shutting down the servers in a couple of hours . What do you want to know ? What do you want to remember ? What 's your favorite reddit memory ? "
 ... .. ( one hour passes ) 
 ... .. ( another hour ) 
 ... .. ( three hours now ) 
" ... ... ( four hours , no responses . no votes . nothing ) "
 Nothing ? Ok then . It 's time to go . Farewell old friend . It 's been a fun ride .

“ Number 108 , today ’ s your turn , ” a voice rang through my skull as it shook me from sleep . I panicked ; throwing off the sheet as I frantically looked around me for my clothes . My hands came into contact with a silky cloth , softer than anything I had touched before . A grimace formed on my face as I touched the sheer dress , grabbing handfuls of it onto my body . So this was it then ; the day I would meet the king . "
" I bit back my urge to scream as the jailer tied my hands . Slaves took me from the simple room , leading me to a small bath chamber . They washed me meticulously , easing the dirt and grime out of my hair , vigorously scrubbing my skin . My skin became pale , and then flushed . Oils were rubbed into my skin . My nails were clipped and filed . My terror built as I looked for a way to avoid the confrontation , but I could think of nothing . "
" A pair of guards entered . Their faces and bodies were hidden by dark robes and curved blades hung at their waists . They waited as I adorned the dress and blindfolded me . A firm hand was placed over my own , leading me forward . I ’ m not sure how long I walked through corridors up a flight of spiraling stairs , but I was shaking by the time I arrived . I felt lecherous eyes probe me , confirming what the luxurious carpet and thick incense had made me suspect . "
" “ They ’ ve certainly brought me a pretty one today . What ’ s your name ? Ah , it won ’ t matter anyways , after tonight. ” The voice hit me like rolling thunder , and I shook under its impact . <newline> “ M-my Great King… it ’ s that time of month . I ’ d be b-b-better able to serve you in a fortnight , ” I stuttered . Cold sweat appeared all over my body . "
" The king roughly pulled off my blindfold , evaluating my face . The light stung my eyes and I blinked tears . “ I ’ ve killed a hundred treacherous girls ; did you think none tried to lie to me ? ” "
" Suddenly rage filled my mind . I had done nothing to deserve this . I ’ ve worked hard all my life in the village , but I ’ m here just because of a Nobel ’ s jealousy . I calmed my trembling and stared back into the King ’ s eyes . "
" “ Very well , off me if you will . There ’ s a girl from my village , the Overseer ’ s daughter . She is also a virgin , and is much prettier than me . Promise me , you ’ ll kill her next ! ” "
" The king laughed ; a single sound at first . The laugh continued , and before long he was gasping for breath . "
" “ You won ’ t be killed tonight , ” the King said as he spun around and fell into his blankets . "
 “ Not tonight ? Then am I… ? ” 
" “ We ’ ll see , we ’ ll see. ” "
" I laughed nervously as the bell chimed midnight . <newline>
Here you are again . Back to same point you were 365 days ago . Your house littered with empty bottles . You keep telling yourself this year is it . The year you will finally get your life back on track . But you ca n't . Alone . Nothing but an empty shell of your former self . You throw away the last mirror in your house . You take one final look , disgusted . The only evidence of your existence remains in a photo of you and her . You take a final swig and collapse helplessly on the floor . Your dreams soon become bitter memories . You remember five years ago you told her the same resolution you made this year , but you lied to her then . You never did that before . She asked if you were okay to drive after that New Years Eve party , and you said `` Yes. '' . Another lie….Another failed resolution .
*Northeast of Syria , heavily fortified city Deir ez-Zor . * "
" Sandstorm was over . It cost Syrian Arab Army 26 well-trained soldiers and northeast quarters of the city called Baqiyah . SAA was low on morale . After all they were besieged for more than 2 years now by cruel men who is going to kill them , torture them and rape & pillage whatever they care about in the city . "
" At the Baqiyah , Euphrates Hotel ISIS was singing songs and chanting over victory . They were successful at using sandstorm as cover and they got a hold of strategic part of the city to launch attacks from . "
" ISIS was using inexperienced newly joined forces in fronts such as Palymra or other hopeless places that they are definitly going to lose . But These guys were different , they were the elites of ISIS forces called shock troops . They were battle hardened soldiers that ISIS used to take Mosul , Raqqa and North of Aleppo . Nobody fucked with these guys and lived to tell the tale . "
 While they celebrate the half victory a guy enters from the revolving door of the hotel . He was tall guy with a lanky arms and he looked really skinny under that traditional arab clothes . He was looking like a giant beach umbrellas . 
 `` Hello comrades '' He says . Nobody says anything back to him . Being heavily radical islamists they were n't drinking shit at the party so everyone was sober . Yet the situation was so bizarre they were struck like lighting. `` hoorayy Allah may peace upon him am I right ? we really owned those suckers . Now where is the booze and hoes '' 
" `` Since medieval wars , since your kind first came to these lands . Only infidels chanted hooray . We chant 'Allah Allah'. `` says the leader of the group ( his beard was the longest ) and raises his AK-47 . The rest of the group surrounds the tall guy . "
" `` Yikes , that was n't successful i guess . Ok man you have struck an cord with history and I am really impressed . Now drop your guns or I will swear to god , Allah or whoever the fuck is I will blow your fucking brains all over the floor '' "

"
I could rule the world if I wanted to . Be revered by all mankind and be looked at as a God . But I will do none of this . I will not help the world nor will I harm it . I 'm not interested in that anymore , I 'm not really interested in anything anymore . "
" Many people would say I 'm selfish for thinking the way I do . Being able to help the entire world , yet I do nothing . I could tell people why I think this way , but they would n't understand . You see I know life is meaningless , I know there 's no point or moral to be had . That every action is n't worth the effort . Of course others think this way , but there 's a difference between thinking you know and actually knowing . I did n't always have this mind set though . The way I think is a result of the power that was bestowed upon me . One that I did not ask for , and certainly would never want . "
" You see when I die , I wake up as my six year old self . You would think it would be amazing . To keep re-living your life doing everything you wished you could have done , but that 's not the case . You see it takes away life 's meaning . Everyone else 's life has meaning , or at least it does to them , and that thought is all I wish I could have . The thought that anything I do has some value . For me everyday is like being trapped in a glass jar with the oxygen slowly running out , but it never does . I can never die no matter how much I want to . "
" In the beginning it was different . Life would have been exciting , it would have been enjoyable . To be able to re-live life , correct all stupid things I did , to ask the love of my life out , to work harder and make myself better than I was before . I tried to learn everything I could . From the arts to engineering I wanted to learn it all . "
" I would eventually know how to build quantum computers or make sustainable fusion . I would know how to make the cure to cancer and the common cold . I even learned how to create worm holes and transverse entire galaxies in mere seconds . It took a while to learn this of course , I never was the sharpest tool in the box . But when you have lived billions of years you can pretty much learn anything . "
" Eventually I could single handedly progress all humanity millions of years ahead of what it should have been . We would land on Mars and have a colony before the 21st century . The whole world would be run by fusion plants by the year 2005 . And then there was the way to prolong life , almost infinitely . That 's when I made the biggest mistake of my life , to choose willingly to never die , and so I lived for billions of years in a single life . All the way til the universe was starting to end . "
" We tried to stop it , we tried practically everything . We even build an entire artifices galaxy just so we could try to survive , but nothing would work . It was then that I learned the truth of life . That everything comes to an end , that life is really meaningless . I then awoke , just as always as a six year old boy in my mothers arms . I looked at her face , a face I had n't seen in almost 30 billion years . This was when my life ended , at that moment . Although I still breath and have a heart beat , I am dead inside .
It 's another normal day in Westfield except something 's a little off . While I 've been running off the locals from the graveyard to rob the deceased , I 've been dressing as a zwombie and using a projection to fool police . It 's a small town so keeping the word from getting out was easy . Cut a few telephone lines and flatten a few tires and no one will ever know . Today was different though , this morning a can pulled in . "
" <newline> I immediately flatten the front tires so they ca n't escape . After watching them for a little bit , I ca n't help but notice they 're some sort of mystery solving group . Are they fucking kidding me ? A stoner and his dog , some preppy looking douche , a librarian and a slut ? Who are these people ? I ca n't let them leave and I need to hide the evidence . Once I find the grave of the nobleman who was buried here and his treasure I can leave but I ca n't have them snooping around . "
" <newline> I already had some open graves dug so I waited for them to come liking around the graveyard . This is going to be too easy , I 'm going to use the projector to scare them right into running into the graves . Something unexpected happened though . The dog started digging up the treasure . How the fuck did he find it ? That 's ok though , these kids are about to get it . "
" <newline> I scared preppy boy and the slut into a hole that is too muddy to escape . The librarian lost her fucking glasses and crawled into a crypt that I locked behind her . As for the stoner and dog , pot brownies sitting on a tombstone really got the best of them . "
" <newline> While I was going to kill them , I decided against it . They never saw me and I got all the treasure . These dumb fucks literally just helped me finish even faster . I should really leave some money for those tires though ...
The computer gave a three note chime of discovery , waking Ben from his light doze . He knuckled his eyes , feeling grimy . They ’ d been out for six weeks , nearly double the length of a normal run , but had been having bad luck . Every wreck he ’ d scanned up was tagged , and touching them was against the law . He figured he had enough problems without Galactic police hunting him down , so he ’ d moved on . But every time , his worry sharpened . He had a family to provide for , and a salvager who couldn ’ t find wrecks starved . "
" After the tenth time pinging a tagged wreck , he ’ d decided to sweep an asteroid belt . He hated to take the risk , but they were running out of time . He hadn ’ t bothered to wake Jade up from hypersleep and ask her if she minded putting their lives at risk . She would have just shrugged , anyway . "
" Ben thought sometimes that God had forgotten to put fear in that woman when He made her . Or any other emotions . The only things she expressed interest in were wrecks , and spending as much time in hypersleep as possible . He had a wife and daughter , and left skipping across time to Jade , who cared for no one . They had been partners for twenty years , and she didn ’ t look a day over twenty-three , while Ben was starting to gray . He had a feeling she would long outlive him . But at least when he ’ d asked her to split their income 70/30 , she had just shrugged . "
 “ Is it tagged ? ” Ben croaked at the computer . 
 “ Tag not found. ” 
" “ How big is it ? ” he asked , excitement beginning to rise . "
 “ Artificial matrices scan over 100 kilometers. ” 
 “ Tag it now ! ” he said joyfully . 
" “ Tagging , ” said the computer obediently , but Ben wasn ’ t listening . He was already out of his pilot ’ s chair and pulling himself to the back of the little wrecker . The ship he owned was almost all cargo bay , but he did have all four sleep pods required by law nestled in the corridor to the main airlock . "
" He punched in the code sequence for sleep release and waited . If he hadn ’ t been in zero gravity he would have bounced from foot to foot , but instead he fidgeted by pushing himself back and forth between the corridor walls . "
" At long last the pod door slid aside , and Jade floated out , her short black hair standing on end . "
 “ What ’ ve you got ? ” she asked at once . 
" “ Big one , ” he said . “ 100km. ” "
 She gave a small smile . “ We ’ d better get to work. ” 
 ***** 
" The wreck wasn ’ t just large , they soon discovered . It was a transport ship hauling platinum , and Ben was a little surprised the company hadn ’ t sent out a recovery team . Salvagers rarely came across such large , valuable finds . Perhaps the shipping route hadn ’ t been received properly , and the ship was badly off course . A good insurance policy or the risk of the asteroid belt may also have made recovery a losing proposition . "
" In any case , he was glad they hadn ’ t . A wreck like this came once in a lifetime , and would set them up for years . Jade had been tractoring in neat packs of foam-wrapped titanium for two days , and the hold was nearly full . It would take four trips just to retrieve the cargo , and several more for the ship parts . "
" Ben had done two EVAs , searching for the sleep pods . The computer told him it couldn ’ t find any active signals , and he knew that transport ships were often unmanned , but he still always looked . He had found three empty pods , and was suiting up for another EVA to look for the fourth , when Jade opened her mic . "
" “ Ben , you should take a look at this. ” "
 “ Be right there. ” 
" He hooked his helmet to his belt and headed for the cargo bay . His partner was strapped into the tractor control seat outside . Jade was deft with the tractors , able to spin the fine filaments out eight at time without tangling them . She was a worthy partner just for that ; Ben could only handle four tractors at once , and preferred EVAs . "
" “ It ’ s strange , ” she said , pointing at the screen . All eight filaments were out and pointing at the same object . They looked like snakes poised to strike . "
 “ What is that ? ” He peered at the screen . 
" “ I don ’ t know . I thought it was a piece of the ship , but the tractors won ’ t lock on. ” "
 “ Let ’ s get a look at it through one of the tractor cams. ” 
" Jade gave the command , and the object appeared on the screen , much bigger , but still indistinct . "
" “ I think it ’ s an asteroid
So what 's going on here , Bob ? "
" **Well , Dave , the aliens have rounded us all up and paired us off . ** "
 What for ? 
" **According to this brochure , they need human babies to breathe . So we ca n't leave until one of us gets pregnant . ** "
 Oh . 
 **Yeah . Looks like we 're gon na be here awhile . ** 
 Shit . Did you bring anything to read ? 
 **Just the breeding brochure . ** 
 What 's it say ? 
 ** '' Start fucking . We need babies to live . ** 
 Anything else ? 
" **Well , under that it says `` We need babies to live , so if you do n't give us one you ca n't leave . But we -- '' ** "
 Wait ! Do they know about the difference between the sexes ? 
" **Well they flew here , enslaved our planet , rounded us all up , and gave us a brochure in English . That 's more than President Trump ever did for our great-grandparents . ** "
" Not really . Everyone got perms instead of health care . He said it was , and I quote , `` cheaper . '' "
 **And smellier . ** 
 True . Why do we still get perms ? 
 **We 've got plenty of time to discuss this while we 're busy not having a baby . Maybe we can save that hot topic for later . ** 
 *200 YEARS LATER* 
" Hey , did we ever talk about perms ? "
 **Hurry up and get pregnant . ** 
 Why do n't you try for once ? 
 **I 'm shy . And you 're impotent . ** 
 How would you know ? 
 **Remember New Years Eve about 80 years ago ? I had those wine coolers ? ** 
" Well , how many people have you knocked up over the past 200 years ? "
 **I do n't know . ** 
" Well , I can take a guess . Why do they keep injecting us with drugs that have us living this long ? "
" **The wi-fi is out , and they say that we 're the only ones left here . ** "
 We are ? 
" **Yeah , we were the last two people without female partners . The two odd men out . ** "
" Wait , so they KNOW we ca n't make a baby ? "
" **Oh , they do n't need anymore . Turns out they do n't need THAT many babies to live . Just like , you know , five . ** "
 Five ? 
" **Damndest thing , really . ** "
 When did you find all of this out ? 
" **That was the rest of the brochure . `` But we 're cool , because a baby is born every seven seconds and we 'll have you back home in a minute . Just promise us all you 'll make more babies just in case . In return , here 's a coupon for complimentary appetizers at Red Robin , and we 're gon na keep the two leftover guys here because you do n't have enough babies to fix our wi-fi and it would really be sick if we asked for THAT many . Besides , we 're easily amused . `` ** "
 Shit . 
" **Yeah , you should have let me finished . It continues , `` But if those two guys really do n't wan na stick around , they have five minutes to leave . If not we will assume that they did n't read the whole brochure and totally get what 's coming to them . `` ** "
 Double shit . I really should have let you finish reading that brochure . 
 **Yeah . **

`` Hey , Todd ! What 's up ? '' I waved to Todd from across the lobby . He waved enthusiastically back and started to walk over . "
 `` Craig ! Did n't expect to see you today . I see my assassins have failed again ! '' 
" We both gave a hearty chuckle , and he slapped my shoulder a few times as we shared the old familiar joke . "
" `` So how 's the family these days ? Is your wife doing well ? '' he asked , the smile slightly fading from his face . "
" `` They 're decent , you know , not bad . Mary had some pretty bad food poisoning the other day , but the doctor put her on antibiotics and she 's getting better . Got ta be careful with Chipotle these days , I guess . Never thought it 'd happen to us , though , you know ? '' I said thoughtfully . "
" He nodded solemnly . `` I 've heard of some pretty nasty stories coming out of there recently . It 's a shame , really . A damn shame . '' "
" `` It really is . World 's a scary place these days , you know ? Hell , just last month my twin brother ( you 've met Thomas , right ? ) , he got mugged in broad daylight ! Scares me to think that I almost took the kids out to visit him in Long Island last week . That could have been us ! '' I shuddered . "
" He looked disturbed . `` Wow , that 's insane ! Lucky it was n't you , though , right ? '' He smiled a bit at that . "
" `` Yeah , for sure . And there was that time our house was broken into a year ago . We could have been at home then ! But look at me , talking so much . What 's going on with you , man ? I feel like it 's been forever since I last saw you ! Are you still dating that one girl ? Carly , or something ? '' "
" `` Nah , we ended it a few weeks back . It just was n't right , you know ? You know when you feel it , and that just was n't it , '' he concluded . "
" `` Man , I 'm sorry . It seemed like you two got along pretty well . Say , while you 're here , can I ask a big favor of you ? '' I asked suddenly . "
" `` Sure , Craig , what 's up ? '' "
" `` Well , I was driving here , and believe it or not my brakes stopped working almost as soon as I got off the interstate ! Luckily I was already going pretty slowly and was able to pull off to the side and get the parking brake going before I called a tow truck , but now I 'm stuck here without a ride , and I do n't want to make Mary get up and drive me back home while she 's still sick . I can pay for gas and everything . '' "
" `` Absolutely , man , I 'd be glad to . Do n't worry about gas , that 's totally fine . Talk about good luck , though . That could n't have been better timing ! '' He almost looked frustrated . I guess I probably was screwing up his schedule a bit . "
" `` Hey , thanks a ton . I 'm really sorry . I owe you one for this . I 'll meet you up by the front doors when we get off . See you around ! '' I started to walk away . "
 `` Sure thing . See you around ! '' Todd turned and left in an opposite direction . 
 - 
" As promised , I met Todd at the door later in the day with my bag over my shoulder and a small sealed box in my hands . He gave me a questioning look . "
" `` Ready to go ? Say , what 's that box ? I do n't remember you having that earlier . '' "
 I shrugged and answered truthfully . `` No idea . Someone delivered it earlier today and said not to open it until I got home . Probably Freddie . You know how much he likes to play the secret agent . '' I chuckled . Todd apparently did n't find this as funny as I did . 
" We walked out to his car and had a surprisingly silent and awkward ride back to my home . After I clambered out of his old 2001 Honda Accord , he waved goodbye with a somewhat strained smile on his face before peeling out . "
" I unlocked the front door and went to check on Mary to make sure she was doing okay . She was sleeping peacefully on the couch in the living room , somewhat pale but still looking as beautiful as ever . I smiled slightly to myself . Suddenly , I had the feeling that I had forgotten something . "
 The box ! I had left it in the back of Todd 's car ! 
" I sprinted outside as quietly as possible and tried hopelessly to catch him before he got too far away , but he was gone . "
" And that was the last I ever saw of Todd . That night , when Mary and I watched the evening news after putting the kids
I look up from my laptop after a 3-hour study-binge . 3:46am . Eyes still raw from hours of straining , I see something out of the corner of my eye . This is n't out of the ordinary , so I ignore it . Slowly I rise from my chair in to a full-on , bone-crackling , almost orgasmic stretch . A couple squints and my vision focuses on a small envelope sitting in the middle of my floor in front of my closet . `` That 's odd , '' I thought . I did n't recall getting any mail today and I certainly did n't recall dropping it on the floor . "
" <newline> The front of the envelope reads 'Rachel ' scrawled in red sharpie . My heart beat starts to pick up . I absolutely would have remembered getting a hand-addressed letter . Let 's be real , I do n't have a lot of friends and it is a rare occasion indeed that I receive any mail at all that is n't a bill or junk . "
" <newline> I think back to the last time I smoked , about four hours ago . I came down completely at least two hours ago . Smoking usually relaxes me but it 's moments like this I know exactly why I 'm so paranoid . "
" <newline> I consider this , snort to myself and grab the envelope off the ground . I dig a nail in to the side of the seam and tear it open . A small , white piece of stationary flies out as I rip the thing open in excitement . My 21st was a month ago , but knowing my family , this could be some late , much-needed birthday money . I unfold the sheet and begin to read the note . As my eyes scan the sentiment , my mouth runs dry and my heart drops out of my ass . "
" <newline> `` Rachel , "
" As I stand here looking at you now , you have never looked more beautiful . Vulnerable . Delicious . "
 You 'll see what I mean . 
" Much love , "
 Your Roomie '' 
 
 My eyes snap towards the closet door . Closed . I do n't close this door because the handle is busted and drifts ajar on its own . The only way it will stay closed is if someone were to hold it from the other side . I audibly gasp when I make this revelation . 
" <newline> As if taking this as an invitation , I see the closet door slowly begin drifting open . I back towards my dresser and retrieve the large pocket knife I was gifted at my high school graduation . `` Be careful out there sweetheart , '' I hear my dad 's voice echo in my head , `` there are a lot of weirdos in the big city , and they all want a piece of you . '' "
" <newline> I think back to everything I 've ever learned in my years of hunting . I think of my first kill , a middle-aged man . He had this wild look in his eyes as I was carving out his jugular . The look of a person begging to live . I revel in this . I think of the motto we are taught : Eat , or be eaten . I grab the door knob and slam the damn thing open . <newline>
The man from the council stared blankly the animal at the centre of the complaint , he looked at complaint the report `` Large unruly animal , a real monster you ca n't miss it '' . "

Would you like one eh ? Hungry girl , here ya go '' Farmer Thompson reached into a bag and pulled out a small red fox and threw with all his might into the paddock .

Antarctica : The Final Frontier "
 No one saw Antarctica as a priority . It was just `` that cold place '' that no one cared about . Then we found it ... 
" Beneath the ice , we found a capsule . It was 100 feet long and 50 feet tall . On the side was writing that was completely unknown . Scientists detected high energy amounts emanating from it . Then one day , it opened . "
" Inside were humans . Upon awaking , they told us how they did n't remember a thing . They were very strange . But the strangest part was their genetic sequence . It was completely different than humans , but it encoded into creating a human , kind of like how you can solve a math problem in two ways .
`` I 'm flattered . '' right after I got hit by a huge truck , a male figure with black wings entered my field of vision . "
" `` Handsome as always , Azrael . '' I stood up , ignoring my broken body . `` May I ask , what in this humble human 's act that flatter you ? '' "
" `` Never before a human took the phrase *'flirting with death'* quite literally like you , Miss Reinia . '' Azrael smiled . `` Well , it 's not like I dislike your attention . So , this is third time this month , how long do you plan to stay ? '' "
" I laughed sourly `` You know full well that no matter how much I like your company , I wo n't let myself got hit by a truck intentionally . '' "
" `` There 's no way to know if it 's you , Reinia . '' a tinge of mischief glittered in his eyes . `` So , care to join me for an evening tea ? '' "
 `` It 's exactly noon though . '' 
" `` Who cares ? This place has no time , after all . '' "
" I followed him into one of the open doors , it was supposed to be a small cafe , but the interior was far larger than the exterior permits . `` One of the perks of being Death 's best friend . '' I muttered unconsciously , gaining his attention . "
 `` Having an inflatable cafe ? '' 
 `` Having no competition would be more appropriate . '' his laugh filled the white marble chamber . 
" `` Trust me , I 'm quite popular in the another world . '' "
" `` True , everyone in the underworld should 've seen you at least once . '' "
" `` Another joke you could only say to Death . '' we both sipped on our tea , and for a while only silence ensues . "
" `` Even so , it 's a truck this time , huh . Must be in the top ten of my painful experience . '' "
" `` Out of curiosity , what is the number one painful experience you had ? '' "
" `` Every single second I spend separated from you . '' I smirked , Azrael scratched his head . "
" `` Well , imagine how painful would it be when your death actually come . '' "
" `` Ah ... '' that 's right , this white world is n't the Realm of Death , but merely the closest part where the World of the Living and the Realm of Death intersect , the place souls have to pass after dying . "
" `` I 'm sorry , that was in a bad taste . '' Azrael fidgeted . "
 `` No problem . '' I sipped my tea agan . 
" `` Say , Reinia ? '' "
 `` Yes ? '' 
" `` If you could stay here forever , would you discard everything in your world ? '' "
" I startled `` That ... I ca n't answer that question ... I 'm sorry , Azrael . That question is not one I could answer . '' "
 `` But why ? '' 
 `` Azrael ... '' 
" `` I thought we loved each other , I thought even if you do n't plan it , you actually wish we could meet again , I thought that even if it 's painful , as long as you could be in my side ... '' "
 He fell silent . 
" `` Death . It 's not your name that I feared , nor the being that you are , nor the inevitability of your arrival . '' "
" `` I 'll return you to your body . It might be a bit painful , but your condition has stabilized . '' "
" `` Wait ! Listen , it 's not because of you that I can not answer your question . '' "
 `` Death should have no business with those that still have the will to live . Death has no right to detain souls that destined to live on . Death should never ... '' a tears dropped from my eyes as I embraced his being . 
" `` It 's not because I do n't love you , that I can not remain in this world ... '' "
 `` Death should never let itself fall in love with beings it can not reach . '' a bright light blinded my eyes as I woke up in the hospital room . 
 `` You 're wrong . '' I whispered . `` It was I who never deserves to fall in love with you . '' tears flowed through my scarred face . 
" In a realm neither of the Death nor the Living , a black-winged being floats in the emptiness . "

`` Good morning , Mr. Choi . The hour is 7:42 AM , Wednesday . Weather foreca- . '' "
" `` Stop . I do n't need the weather report , Vegas , '' Kevin could see the sunlight through his eyelids . His apartment 's management system had already opened up his blinds to wake up him . "
" `` This is the sixth time in the past 22 days that you have interrupted a weather report . Would you like me to discontinue your weather report subscription ? '' Vegas asked . Kevin sat up , his knees pulled towards his chest , his arms resting on his knees , his gaze a muted glare to the touch control and microphone panel at the doorway to his room . He made a mental note to contact ISM ( Interpersonal Services Managers ) customer support to discuss the word choice algorithm in the empathy suite he had installed into the apartment management system . "
" `` What would have been a better word , '' he thought out loud . *Interrupted seemed so , annoyed ? Like the machine was frustrated with being unable to perform it 's function . Declined . Declined would have been better , * Kevin thought to himself . "
 `` Does that cancel my stock ticker updates ? '' 
 `` Yes . I 've made three inquiries to your News Subscriptions . Service Representative Lawrence indicated he spoke with his manager yet again . He indicated he is still unable to separate your services without a rate change as a result of canceling your bundle . He offered alternatives . Would you like to hear them ? '' 
" `` No thank you , Vegas . Bullshit is bullshit regardless of who it 's coming from . '' "
" `` Your word choice suggests you are upset . Would you like me to prepare an extra egg with your breakfast ? Your most recent blood sample indicates your cholesterol levels have been ... .healthy ... for ... the past 1,420 days , '' Vegas said . "
" `` No , thank you . I 'll eat at the office . They cook better than you do . Coffee is just fine , '' Kevin said as he pulled his arms through the sleeves of his dress shirt and eyed the overnight package of stubble his chin had delivered . "
" `` I am sorry that my culinary systems are not up to standards . ISM has indicated a patch is due for release in two months to fix the salt and oil ratio bug . Coffee is brewing . You are down to 6 , Keurig canisters . You have opted not to restock . Is this correct ? '' "
" `` Yes . Vegas , disable your voice simulator for one hour , switch to overhead text , and call Sharon . '' "
" His apartment had no soft surfaces with the exception of his furniture . No carpets . No rugs . He had wood flooring , real wood , not the fake stuff imported out of South America . Brushed steel plates hung on the exposed concrete walls , giving his space an industrial look that Sharon hated . She hardly stayed over . If he was honest with himself , that was half the point of his interior design choice . A home that felt that way only to him . "
" `` Morning , beautiful , '' Kevin cooed as he heard the telltale click of the call being picked up . He smoothed out his consonants , lowering his voice to give it that deep resonance she loved to hear when he woke up next to her . "
" `` Would be better if you were here , even more so if you would be original , '' her voice had just a bit of gravel . Sharon was a snorer . "
" `` I can be tonight , assuming we 're still on for tonight . I 'll bring a bottle of your favorite wine and make lamb chops . '' "
 `` Only if you stay over . '' 
 `` Done . You heading into the office today ? '' 
" `` I could . Or I could take the day off so I 'm fresh for you when you get here , '' she laughed playfully , `` maybe you could do the same ? '' Kevin imagined the mischievous look she had on her face , and grinned . "
 `` Sorry . Got paperwork to catch up on . Captain 's been threatening me with an enema if I do n't get it done . '' 
" Kevin stopped abruptly in the hallway leading up this front door , one hand sliding on his right shoe , the other clipping his handgun to his belt . He looked up to see a holographic projection of Sharon 's face , her features still soft through the grimace she wore . He smiled back apologetically . "
" `` Did n't need that image , Kevy . '' Kevin blew her a kiss . "
 `` I 'll make it up to you . '' 
" `` You had better . ''
I sat at my desk , racking my brain to find who could have possibly discovered the truth behind the death of Phillip Mercer , the heir to one of the most powerful petroleum companies in the world . The job was done without a scrap of evidence , I made sure of that much . It simply made no sense , every living soul that knew I killed Mercer were the very ones that orchestrated it . I may not know who this mysterious person is but I do know that I will answer their question with a bullet to the brain . "
" It was nearly 3:00 AM when I heard muffled footsteps down the hallway . I reached for the silenced 9MM pistol in my bag , aiming for the only entrance to my corner office . The doorknob began to turn as I steadied my aim . Sweat was trickling down my spine , my heart pounding as if I were about to come face to face with the devil himself . The second it took for the door to open felt like an eternity , but I would have rather endured that second of agonizing torment for the rest of my life then to meet the eyes of Phillip Mercer when the door opened . "
" His face was covered in scar tissue , leaving it almost unrecognizable . It was the eyes that were the giveaway . The look in his eyes was the same as the night I thought I killed him . There was a look of superiority in them , as if to let me know I would never be capable of surpassing him in any way . "
" `` There is no way , you should be dead ! '' were the only words I was capable of mustering . "
" `` For all intensive purposes I still am , thanks to you '' he replied with an odd sense of calm in his voice . `` Will you at least give me the courtesy of an answer now that I am here ? God knows I have been to the depths of hell and back in these last 5 years so surely you can give me that . I will answer any questions you have after . '' "
" I recounted the entire tale that crossed our two paths on that fateful night 5 years ago . I told him how I was approached by a man that worked for Prism International , the most powerful energy corporation in the world . Prism stood to gain billions from the collapse of Mercer Petroleum , giving them an even tighter stranglehold on the energy market . The terms were simple enough , kill Phillip Mercer or have everyone I love systematically killed . The choice was made for me . My military background coupled with the fact I helped my step-father design the Mercer home made me the obvious choice for the job no doubt . From there I told him how I was able to bypass the security of his mansion because I helped design it . `` What it boils down too is your life meant less to me then those of my loved ones . The part I do n't understand though is how your still alive ! I shot you in the head , then as you collapsed you knocked over a candle , starting a fire that destroyed your home . '' "
" `` I survived by nothing more then luck . Your bullet went through the side of my jaw , lodging itself in the cheek region of my skull . The heat of the fire brought me surging back to consciousness allowing me to escape but not without being badly burned . The thought of revenge has been the only force driving me to stay alive . I have feared that you might have been merely a pawn being controlled by Prism so that they could buy up my fathers company . But dammit would have been so much easier to enact my revenge if it had simply been you though . But now that I know my worst fears have been realized I at least know what I am up against . '' "
 `` You ca n't possibly think you could take down Prism single handed ! '' 
" `` I wo n't have to do it alone because your going to help me . '' He said with his eyes glimmering with more determination than superiority . It was the kind of look that was impossible to refuse . <newline>

 `` I can hear you trying to sneak by . '' 
" For a moment Phil thought he got lucky . His bosses chair was turned around , facing the window . He figured he could tip-toe past his bosses office undetected so he could meet his girlfriend for lunch fifteen minutes early . "
" `` I.. I 'm sorry Mr . Crawford . '' Phil stammered . Mr. Crawford spun his fully adjustable leather chair around , revealing steepled fingers and a sly , closed-lip smile . Mr. Crawford had been given a nickname for his strict deadlines , unforgiving adherence for reprimand , and the general super-villain-esque way he carried himself around the office . They called him `` Doctor Doom . '' Just like the comic book villain . At some point it became abbreviated to just `` Doom . '' "
" Doom sniffed the air and gave a quick glance over Phil 's blatantly guilty and unnerved posture . He then stared Phil in the eyes , and his grin got slightly larger . "
 `` That 's the same atrocious tie you wore last time you tried to sneak out early . '' 
" Doom spoke with his usual confident and nonfluctuating tone . His mild southern accent would be a great voice for radio , had he not inspired so much conditioned terror in his conversational counterparts . "
" `` Tell me , where is it this time ? Banking errand ? You want to beat the Friday lunch lines ? Hmm ... No . Fidgety Phil , you 've been working on the Wilson account all morning , a big account NO ? Normally your nervous little fingers would have plied patterns in your miserable excuse of an 'Ivy league ' crew . But no , your hair is styled , styled like you spent office time fixing it in the washroom , yes ? And that smell , you wreak of bathtub cologne , and your Walmart brand shoes are shined for once ; tell me , did you tip our poor shoe-shining Joe this morning , or did you stiff him , like you 're about to stiff me out of 15 minutes so you can make it your date on time ? '' "
" `` I.. I was going to stay 15 minutes late at the end of the day s-sir . My girlfriend told me that she was having a rough day , sir . '' Phil 's put his hands in his pockets and submissively stared at the ground . "
" `` Yes . I 'm sure you will stay late tonight ... Phil , do you know why your lunch is between 12:00 and 12:30 ? It 's because that is when I need you to take lunch . If I was to have an emergency at 11:50 , and our client needed an answer to an important question that only you knew , how would we proceed ? '' "
" `` You could call my cell-phone , sir . '' "
" `` Ah . Of course . So when we call and you say that you need to see the file to answer his question , and you 're at the Cactus club , or whatever rube restaurant makes you feel like you 're back on in small-town Virginia , you 'll come right back I assume ? So maybe you pay the waiter and get the food to go , but Friday 's are busy , so you 're out of there when ? 12:03 ? Then nine minutes return , assuming the elevators are n't busy with the traffic of honest , hard-working employees on their real lunchbreak . Now our client has been waiting 30 minutes for his answer and you have missed your opportunity to pacify your girlfriends fragile sensibilities . '' "
" `` I . Well , I just figured I made good progress this morning on the Wilson account I could maybe go do something for my g- '' "
" `` **NO** , your progress is circumstantial and your excuses are ad hoc . The pestering little whims that circle through your head have made you their slave Phil . You are a slave to little buzzes of immediate gratification and helping yourself to company time . I see you taking extra coffee breaks and fooling around with Pam at reception when there is still work to be done . '' "
" `` And this 'consoling ' you will be doing for your girlfriend , that fifteen minutes will help you do it ? Or maybe you need the time for something else , maybe you need to visit the bar first , have a little shot for courage ? ... ... ... Oh do n't respond Phil , your employer just accused you of drinking on the job . It 's not a secret or anything , your hands have been shaking since you got here this morning , and you spilled your coffee already . Tell me , what else did you spill ? Perhaps on one of your frequent bathroom breaks you took one of those tacky little airport liquor bottles , maybe one or three ? And your hands , that shake , your nervous little ticks.. I guess you have enough cologne to cover up the smell though , yes ? '' "
" Phil 's face turned red , and his lips quivered into a painful grimace as he choked back anxious tears . `` I'm.. Sir , please . I need this job . '' "
" `` Yes , I know you do . You are 23 and in your first job ever , no ? I saw your
I have a recurring dream , you are always in it . "
" You are more scared than i have ever known you to be . Your mouth is bent and twisted . I would call it a look of dismay , but dismay is a human emotion . Your face is not that of a woman ’ s . Your face is marred with desperate , animal , panic . Your face , is a mask of terror , unshackled from social graces , like a crying infant , a dying dog . <newline> Figures in the background bob and dance . "
" They whisper . Their voices are deep , their laughter is confusing . <newline> The words send you spinning . The darkness melts away , the sinister void gives way to brick and stone . <newline> The comfort of familiarity is gone . In this place there is no sky . This world is an aberration , it exists between the cracks . "
" You sit for a awhile and weep . I can feel your sadness . You miss the ones you love . <newline> You run , in an alien world . You see the black slim , sandwiched between two cracked . You see it for a second , but that 's all it takes . You blink . The slime is growing through the brick . As a torrent it breaks through the stone walls . It pours in with ferocity and force . "
" The black slime moves quickly , coating the walls as you run . You are cornered , turning around to come face to face with a wall of the corrosive goo . A single eye opens in its centre , followed by thousands more as tendrils slowly slither towards you . I embrace you with my appendages , sloppy and jagged . I take everything you are . I taste you and remember . "
" I listen and , sometimes , i can hear . "
" Forever-we dream our dreams , together .
I sat in the small , uncomfortable plane . The erratic beating of my heart was no less peaceful than the turbulent winds outside . Desperate times called for desperate measures . "
" The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature . A half-century old rifle was brutally effective , clunky and inhumane . All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering . Modern guns , bombs and planes , like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range , reliability and stealth . "
" The soft blinking of the light told me to prepare . That was a farce ; I did n't need to prepare . There was n't a parachute to drop me . That would just make me easier to hit on the way down . The only other man noticed it as well and with a face no less grim than my own began popping open the airtight box . Very carefully , with both hands , he gave me a simple piece of wood with a rock tied to the end . "
" `` You 're going to bomb them back to the stone age , Soldier . '' "
" All I had to do was hit the ground .
I have always been careful . ALWAYS . How the HELL did I get caught ? ! "
" I struggle against my straps , not even noticing when someone comes in . Man I 'm getting sloppy ... or rusty ... hmm rusted blades , there 's an idea ... "
" The person speaks , it 's a woman ? `` I have been watching you for some time ... '' "
" That can NOT be good . So I turn on the charm . `` Oh really ? Well I wish you would 've shown yourself , maybe I could watch you~ '' and wiggle my eyebrows . Yeah , weird , but ladies seem to be easier drawn when guys are FUNNY rather than too flirty . "
 She huffs a breath . `` I ... I ca n't let you out of your straps just yet . Not . Not yet . '' She hacks a cough into her elbow . Ew . Germs . 
 She stands up a little straighter . `` Does the name Ricardo mean anything to you ? '' 
" I had to search through my aliases before it clicked : I had , of course , a family . Ricardo was my older brother . He was ... kinda good . Was n't abusive , did n't drink too often . "
" However , just last year he was shot and killed by a very well-known mob boss . "
" They could n't arrest him , especially when I doused out my own brand of justice . "
 Heh . Doused . 
" After a moment , I nodded slowly . `` What about it ? '' "
" She hacked a cough , and I could see the speckled blood . `` I ... I was in love . And we were going to be married soon . I got pregnant , and well , had his baby . However , he died before the baby was even born . '' "
 Oh . *Oh* . I 'm ... an uncle ? My brother was a *father* ? What ... 
" She coughed out a sob . `` I have end-stage lung cancer , due to not smoking but from an infection in a not very well sterilized operation room . I do n't have long to live . I know you 're his brother you look just like him ! '' "
" She came closer . She was a ... pleasant woman . Wavy locks of brown , deep brown eyes . Plump cheeks . She was nice . "
" I knew what she was asking of me , why she could n't ask our parents . They were long dead . "
" She hovered over my straps , and I nodded . She undone me , and I sat up . `` May I see the child ? '' "
" She nodded with tears in her eyes , and whisked up something out of the crib nearby . She tilted the babe . She , and it was a she , had curled black hair like my brother . Sleeping . "
" The mother sniffed . `` I know you ... kill people . And I know some may find that reprehensible , but honestly I also know how you are with kids , how your brother was . I have faith in you . '' "
" I agreed . I loved kids . I would love this niece of mine , this daughter of my brother . "
" I gently took her away , understanding when the mother 's arms tightened even for a moment before relaxing . "
" She gave me instructions : feedings with formula , or the milk in the fridge . I could take it all home , along with the crib and the toys and anything . "
" Finally , she stood stock still , a woman with a plan . `` I ca n't suffer any longer . Would you ... ? '' "
" I nodded again , and gently covered the little girl in my arms , moving the blanket over the tiny , tiny ears . "
 She left . 
" I knew what she was going to do , and so I went outside , and I coddled my new found family . "
 And I waited . 
" I gathered up the child 's belongings , made it seem like , say , a kidnapping , then put in a 911 saying that someone was shot . "
 I left . 
" The child , her name was Keke . A wonderful name . "
" I think I 'll stop killing , just ... just for a while . So I can get in the swing of things with her ... just a little while ...
`` Let 's go . Up and at 'em asswipe . '' "
" I slowly opened my eyes after I thought I had closed them forever . I looked down and around me every which way . There was nothing but empty space . It did n't have a color or any sort of look I could put into Earthly terms . It just looked like emptiness in the most basic sense of the word . I had no body . I had no idea how I was even seeing things or comprehending words . In front of me was a man sitting at desk with a large stack of papers . He was short and slightly overweight . He wore thick glasses and combed his thin , brown hairs over his hopelessly obvious bald spot . He looked like a man who had n't had a day off in centuries . Tired , detached , and largely indifferent . "
 `` Come on Jocko you 're supposed to move in front of the desk and address me . '' 
 `` How should I address you Sir ? '' I asked as I moved whatever I was towards him . 
 `` I 'm the Supervisor . Now look here Jocko you 've got a difficult record to pick out . I 'm going over your previous lives here and I 'm not too impressed . You died today at the age of 55 from cirrhosis . But we 'll go over that life later . In the life previous to this one you served in World War II . When you returned home you were paralyzed from the neck down and your wife left you for some American GI she met when they marched on Paris and you were still stuck on the Eastern front watching your pals get their brains blown off by Nazis . You killed yourself a while after that . I ca n't say I blame you . '' 
 `` What are you talking about ? My previous life ? This is the only one I 've ever lived ! '' 
" `` Not quite Jocko , let 's just say the world is n't what you made of it . We created everything , we watch everything , and someday we will end everything . We 're the closest thing to any of your Gods there is . '' "
 `` Who is we ? What are you talking about Supervisor ? '' I somehow managed to stammer . 
 `` Jeez Louise the worst part of my job is the repetitiveness . Each of you always ask the same questions . I swear you could replace me with a tape recorder and a computer . I do n't know the answers to that question . My superiors do n't tell me much . All 's I know is it 's my job to re-assign you to a new body once your old one has passed . The conditions of your next birth are based on the life you previously led . You 're next in line . '' 
 `` A new body ? But how -- '' 
" `` I 'm going to have to stop you there Jocko there 's a long line behind you . Now onto the analyzation of your most recent life . I felt bad for you after your death in 1958 so I put you in an excellent position for your new life . You were given the bodily aptitude to be a star quarterback . I put you in a middle class home in suburban Los Angeles . Your father was a quarterback in college himself and had a stable job as a plumber . You were given exceptional arm strength , exceptional vision , and the ability to make tough and correct decisions immediately . You were a star in high school and you let it get to your head . The girls , the parties , the cars . It was all just too much for you was n't it , Jocko ? '' "
 `` It was n't as simple as you made it sound . My old man was an asshole . School was the only place I was accepted . '' 
" `` This is n't a hearing Jocko you do n't get a chance to defend yourself . Me reading this aloud is simply for the benefit of my superiors . You got your first jail-time at age 18 . Assault in a bar fight . Lost your scholarship to Stanford . After you got out you became a mechanic ( and a shitty one too , I might add ) . But boy , you still loved to drink . Those high school parties must 've really been stuck in your head huh ? You hit the dive bars every night until you were too shitty to stand . You met a nice girl there one night did n't you though ? Knocked her up real good . She came crying a while later in that same bar because it was the only place she knew she could find you . Told you she was pregnant . You knocked her upside the head and walked out . Never saw here again did you Jocko ? '' "
 `` I was young and drunk . I made a fucking mistake . '' 
" `` That was n't your only mistake . By this time you were about thirty . Your boss got sick and tired of you showing up drunk all the time and gave you the can one day . For five years you just laid around drunk until you were out on the street . Wandered around the streets for about ten years until you managed to get a job as
Elon walked along the forest trail , breathing deeply of the smell of decaying leaves and cold . The sun was setting and the short , pale winter day had barely even melted last night 's frost from the ground . He looked up at the sky , watching the now familiar arrangement of stars through the cold , dry air and the clouds of condensation from his breath . "
" It seemed like a sadly appropriate setting for the last few minutes of the human race . Winter and nightfall , the end of the cycle . Elon mused for a moment on how the cycle of seasons seemed to be a constant source of symbolism in the stories of all cultures that came from a place with a changing year . While the weather of his childhood was vastly different from that of his adopted home , the simple stories seemed to endure , no matter where you are . "
" He absentmindedly brushed his pocket where his smartphone usually was . It was , of course , gone . He had discarded it hours ago . It was doubtlessly buzzing away in the train station locker as hundreds of notifications , questions and urgent attempts at contact avalanched into it . Pointless buzzing . He had no desire for it to break his final enjoyment of the apocalypse . "
" The sky had faded from the pale champagne of the winter sunset to a deep purple . High cirrus clouds framed the growing green glow of the aurorae that were starting to dance , just a few seconds later than he had expected . Silent green and red fire wound in huge , sinuous curtains across the entire sky in a few seconds , far , far brighter than they had been in at least several million years . "
" Piercing through them , a painfully bright purple light blazed in the sky where Mars normally would have hung . All contact with the Martian colony would have been lost about 2 hours ago . Judging by the color and intensity , Elon quickly estimated that the surface temperature of the poor , dead planet must be climbing into the low millions of degrees as the final waves of neutronium kinetic impactors hammered it at nearly the speed of light . "
 At least the final curtain call for this place was pretty . Elon did not feel much guilt about humanity . *Homo sapiens* was an intriguing species and burned bright with potential . But it suffered the fate of being at the wrong place at the wrong time . The only technologically advanced sapient entity in 500 light years but still far too primitive to escape from the doom that was now bearing down upon them . Such was the story of countless millions of other species across the galactic disk over the last 2.7 billion years of recorded history . There was no sense in melancholy over an event as common as the rain washing away loose specks of dirt . 
" Elon took another deep breath , enjoying the exotic scents of the forest . So many unique chemical signatures , such a complex biochemical web . The loss of Earth 's biosphere was a loss that he did feel with a keen , cutting pain . So much information , so much diversity , about to be lost forever . He wondered if some of his indifference to his dooming of humanity came from the anger from watching them squander the incomparable wealth they had inherited on this planet . "
" At least he had been able to save some of it . The first few years after landing here , he had spent his time incognito , gathering as many samples as he could from the biosphere . Precious engrams taken of genetic material , biosphere interactions , the flow of energy and chemistry . He had toiled as long as possible before packing up the data - a mere sliver of the bounty here - and launching it on a minus-space drone back to the fleet . There , it would be modified into new forms , integrated into the continuum and giving invaluable diversity to the whole . `` The strengthening of the web is the duty of the unique '' The mantra of his people still echoed through his mind , as clear and beautiful as the day he had learned it . "
" He had cursed the limited time he had . If only the fleet had been better positioned , his scout craft could have ridden to Earth along one of the spacetime currents tracing the ventral edge of the spiral arm and arrived here centuries earlier . It would have taken decades more to do a proper catalog . But any later and he would have run the risk of the drone 's spacetime spoor being detectable by the long-range sensors of the approaching horde . "
" After the probe was gone , he had integrated into human society . A young male , traveling between continents for schooling made for an easy target . A quick assimilation of his bio-signatures and vaporization of the original body was simple . The lack of nearby relatives and the excuses of cultural barriers made his early mistakes in impersonation easy to cover up . Elon had never completely adjusted to this new form . Only two forward facing eyes incapable of visualizing ultraviolet light , the peculiar and problem-prone calcium-phosphate rigid armature for movement - his human shape had come to awkwardly fit like a mis-sized glove , stretched to fit over years of wear . "
" The most difficult task had been the ridiculous 'tense ' structure of English . How a language could have such a complex set of constructs for temporal relationships still baffled
I made myself look out the window again . Through the light drizzle I can still see him standing there , under the dim red glow of the streetlamp . He had n't moved , and he 's still looking . Letting the curtain fall back into place , I slouched back into my chair . "
" He could n't possibly know . That would be impossible . Although ... my gaze shifted to the stack of plane , train and bus tickets on my table . One ways , all of them , and all in the last 6 months . Some from far off places , Russia , Hawaii , Prague ; others from closer , Manchester , France . All from before I 'd learnt how to get home , when I did n't know what was happening to me . Maybe I 'd attracted some attention , coming back from all over the globe , but never going ? Does the government keep tracks on that ? No . Of course not . Who would care ? "
" He 'd been following me to and from work for the past week now , I was sure of that . I 'd thought it better than to start appearing inside work , just in case . But every time I got off the tube , I 'd see him : in the next carriage , on the opposite platform , walking past . I was n't sure it was the same person . But now he was outside my house . "
" I took a glance through the curtains , hoping with all my might that he had gone , that I was being paranoid , that he just happened to be around me . He had n't gone . He was still just standing there , his arm at a perfect right angle holding up his black umbrella . I stared , trying to make out features , trying to come up with a reasonable explanation as to who he could be , what he could want , and why he was following me . "
 Then he vanished . 
"
`` Babe , '' Tyler rubbed her back gently as he stared straight ahead with glassy eyes , `` We 've known about this for a year . We 're prepared . We 've done everything we ever wanted to do . Now it 's time to accept our fate . '' He spoke almost robotic , emotionless . He was just as frightened as she was , but he did n't let it show . He comforted her , but allowed his eyes to remain fixated in front of him . His hand became motionless on her sweat-soaked t-shirt . "
" Kate had been crying violently for the past two hours . Her make-up ran like two long black roads down her cheeks and her nose was red . `` I do n't want t-to die ! '' she exclaimed , mucus dribbling out of her nostrils . "
 He still did n't blink . The world was ending tonight . A massive solar flare was about to reach the Earth 's surface and burn everything up . Including the humans . 
" `` We have so much more life to live ! '' she exclaimed once more , still blubbering . She sobbed , gasping for air and wiping the sweat off the back of her knees which she held tightly against her chest . `` I do n't want to die , '' she whimpered again . "
" `` Neither do I , '' he snapped , tearing his eyes away from the blurred view in front of him and looking at her . `` We ca n't stop it , though . So why do n't you stop wasting our last few hours crying and make the most of them ! '' "
" Her tears stopped immediately and she stared at his with wide eyes . `` I 'm sorry , '' her lip quivered . "
" Tyler 's expression softened and he swallowed hard , `` Me too . You know I love you . '' "
" Kate nodded and wiped her nose with the back of her hand , blinking at the ground in front of her . `` I should call my mom to say goodbye . '' She choked on the last word . "
" Tyler glanced at his own phone as she stood up . She tugged at her shorts and walked uneasily out of the room , preparing to make her final phone call . Tyler 's phone immediately started buzzing , his own mother calling . He answered . `` Hi , Mom . '' "
" `` Baby , '' she responded , her voice more cheerful than he expected , `` Has it happened there yet ? '' <newline> He furrowed his eyebrows , `` What ? The solar flare ? Obviously not ... '' "
" `` No , no . The sunscreen ! '' "
 `` The what ? '' 
" She beamed and he could hear the smile in her voice , `` The sunscreen ! I 'm glowing ! '' "
" He shook his head , his mind becoming frantic and confused , `` Mom , slow down . What are you talking about ? '' "
" She inhaled and then exhaled deeply , `` They 're calling it sunscreen . Apparently every living organism is equipped with a protective shield that is triggered when a solar flare is impending . Who knew ? '' "
" His mouth hung open for a moment as he processed his mother 's words . `` That 's ... ridiculous . Mom , I know you 're upset , but it 's okay . I love you and this was going to happen at some point in our lives -- '' "
" `` No , '' she insisted , `` It 's all over Mexico . Everything is glowing ! '' "
 `` That 's insane . '' 
" `` Honey , '' she continued , `` Scientists are as dumbfounded as you are right now , but it 's true . They expect it to spread across the globe within the next hour . '' "
 He glanced down at his arm and noticed a warmth rising out of it that he did n't see before . `` What the ... '' 
 `` Is it happening ? '' she laughed through the phone 's speaker . 
" Just then , Kate bolted into the room , a wide smile on her face and a yellow glow emitting from her skin . "
" Tyler looked at her , his expression full of amazement . Not removing his eyes from her , he said , `` Yes , Mom . Can you hold on ? '' He slowly put the phone down and stood up , approaching his girlfriend . They smiled at each other for a moment and then he picked her up in a tight hug . "
" She giggled , `` We 're going to be okay ! '' "
" He laughed joyfully at that , kissing her cheek several times as he set her down . They then proceeded to click on the television to confirm what was happening . Without a doubt , scientists around the world were shown celebrating and explaining the phenomenon . "
" <newline> Two hours later , the world lit up . An hour after that , it lit up again . With fireworks and relief .
`` Someone will find out about this ... '' the scientist gasped as he tried to crawl away , painting the floor with his blood . "
" John could only smirk as he walked slowly after the old man , a bloodied pen knife in his hand . `` Oh , I doubt they will . It has been what ... three years ? And people are still trying to figure it out . '' "
" The scientist somehow managed to reach his desk , and his hand went for the phone . "
" `` Oh no you do n't , '' John said , before plunging the knife into the scientist 's hands . He howled in agony . "
" `` Such a pity that your trait is not **Strength** , or else you would have fought me off by now , '' John teased the man , slumped weakly against his desk . The white carpet beneath him was fast turning red from his blood . "
" Seeing that the scientist could no longer move , John quickly scoured his office , picking up files that detailed the danger of the approaching asteroid and throwing them in the middle of the room . "
 `` Why ? '' John heard a weak voice coming from the table . `` Why are you doing this ? '' 
" John chuckled at the question . Almost all of his victims in the past three years asked him that , as they all laid dying before him . No harm indulging the dying scientist his last question . "
" `` Simple , '' John said , as he continued to move across the room . `` It 's fun to watch . '' "
 `` But people will die ! '' the scientist croaked . `` Everyone has been wondering why our traits have gone on prime for three years now . '' 
" `` Yeah , I know , '' John shrugged , throwing more files into the growing pile . He thought of the growing confusion in the public bemusedly , of how everyone is wondering why their traits have gone on prime , signalling an imminent danger , for three years now . `` And thanks to me , they will never know why until it 's too late . '' "
 `` You 're a monster . '' 
" `` No , I 'm not , '' Join replied , his eyes staring at the flame before him . "
" `` I just have a very high **Anarchy** trait , '' John continued , before tossing the lighter towards the files . "

" /r/dori_tales
I woke up , and found myself standing straight up in my bed in the same clothes that i 've always worn . "
 I checked my inventory to see that all my stuff was still there . 
 Pencil : Writing utensil <newline> Weight : 0 <newline> Value : .10 <newline> Quantity : 5000 
 Calculator : Calculation device <newline> Weight : 1 <newline> Value : 15 <newline> Quantity : 1 
 Phone : Communication device <newline> Weight : 1 <newline> Value : 300 <newline> Quantity : 1 
 Everything was there . Good . <newline> Now to say hello to my mother . <newline> `` hello Mom '' <newline> A ) did you sleep well ? <newline> B ) Whats for breakfast ? <newline> C ) can i have 5 money ? ( Requires level 15 speech skill ) 
 let 's go with A 
" `` Mom , what 's for breakfast ? '' "
" `` Sweety , there 's a cereal in the pantry . '' "
 `` OK . Thanks . '' 
" After this i seemed to lose control of my body as i went through the motions of getting cereal , and eating an entire bowl in five seconds . "
 But the stat buff was worth it . 
" Now it was time to walk to school . <newline> Checking my map to see where it was just in case , i began my journey . "
" `` Damn , the road takes me around this mountain . Ai n't nobody got time fo dat ! '' "
 I spent three times the necessary amount of time trying to get over the mountain . After 3 respawns i finally managed it . 
" I arrived at school , and went to my locker . But i had n't written down my code . "
" `` Damn , i need some picks to open this novice lock . I 'll bet there are some in this trash can ! '' "
 *Lockpicks ( 5 ) added to inventory* 
" I then set upon picking the lock , and removing my textbooks , and going to class . "
" I opened my math book , and blam ! *Math skill upgraded to level 15* "
 Then it was time for science . *Science skill upgraded to level 13* 
" Then gym . We were doing laps around the school . After sprinting for half of my stamina bar i let myself recharge a bit by jogging , and then sprinting again . I was in first place . "
" Then we ate lunch . <newline> *picked up potatoes ( 87 ) , carrots ( 50 ) , and tomatoes ( 60 ) . "
" Time stopped as i spent a few seconds wolfing down all of that , except for the tomatoes . Might need those later . The fall damage from my time on the mountain was gone now . "
" After my afternoon classes and various buffs to Speech , Chemistry , and Diction , i began my way home . "
 I only needed to respawn twice this time . 
 After getting home i ran into my brother . He said he wanted to fight . For practice . 
" I equipped my hands , and readied them . I swung left , then right , then left , then right , used a power attack . I was hit by a left-left , right-right , and then a power attack . I began to lose . My Hp was low . "
" I knew what i had to do ! I went into my inventory , and devoured the tomatoes ! "
" My Hp was full now , and i won the fight . <newline> We shook hands , and went to eat dinner . My brother could replenish his Hp there . "
" After dinner i saved my progress , and went to bed . <newline> I slept for exactly 8 hours , and woke up the next day completely awake , and with a `` Well rested '' Stat buff . "
"
( I invented a fictional drug for this ) "
 I woke up on the floor again . The sun was casting a muffled midafternoon light through the thin curtains and I could n't bring myself to feel surprised that I had n't made it to the bed last night . My head was pounding and my mouth tasted like something had died in it . Just another damn day in this stupid shithole . I had to get up . 
" That took a little effort , first , I rolled over onto my stomach , then placed hands firmly on the floor , pushing myself up with some effort , to my knees . Where was it ? Did I have any left ? My thin , yet dextrous fingers fumbled for the box I kept nearby . Nope . It was empty . I swore profusely under my breath before clambering to a standing position . Then , dizziness overcame me . I almost fell back down to the ground , but the wall caught me . I leaned into it 's comforting embrace , stayed there for a while . What time was it ? Did it matter , though ? not like I had anywhere to be . All I needed was another taste of Bliss . "
" The beast gnawing a hole through my stomach growled with the ferocity of a chained and beaten bear . Nothing I could do about it with those empty cupboards though . I sighed , mustering the strength to support my own weight , counting to five mentally and pushing myself off . Wobbled , then reached stability . Bliss . Bliss would fix it , Bliss would fix everything . "
" One tentative foot in front of the next led me to the front door . I 'd left it unlocked . Why had I ... did it matter ? I had nothing left worth stealing . I wandered outside and was immediately almost blinded by the midday glow . Damned UV rays , the sun 'd have someone 's eye out if it was n't more careful where it pointed those things . I was feeling weak . Weaker than usual . Bliss . Bliss was going to make me feel strong again . Powerful . I set off down the balcony that connected the various studio apartments in this block towards his house . "
" Knocked on the door more firmly than I intended to as the Itch began to consume my thoughts . I needed it , needed ... needed it badly . Took him a while to answer , I could feel the infinite ticking of every eternal second that he delayed me . He did n't even wait to hear my question though . Not a word of it 's obviousness . "
" `` You got my money , bitch ? '' he asked . <newline> I sighed and shook my head no , `` can you just ... look , I 'll have some money for you , end of the week , I swear , '' I claimed . No idea if I could make good on that . Doubtful , and he knew it too , `` just a gram ? on credit ? you know I 'm good for it ... '' <newline> He sneered , greasy hair covering his left eye , and reached a scarred , muscular arm out to almost slap me . I felt the air from the near-impact rush past my face , `` you 'll get just a gram when I get my money , '' he told me , slamming the door in my face . "
" I turned , leaned against the cool stone in the harsh sunlight . Needed to find a way to make money . As much as possible . Cost of Bliss only ever seemed to increase , I could remember a time when a fiver would get me enough for a week , now , it barely cut it for a day , and I owed him . "
" I set off back home , racking my brain for ways to make 'his ' money . Nothing came to mind , I mean , I certainly was n't like the other girls , the ones who sold their bodies for a taste of heaven . I had standards , I was n't some dumb junkie whore . Though sometimes that thought , much to my shame , tempted me more than I 'd like to admit . It 'd certainly make things easier . "
" No job , no things left to sell , could n't get another loan . Needed Bliss . Badly . "
" Perhaps if ... but no , that would be wrong . Maybe I could ? "
" I made my mind up , but had no idea if I 'd even have the courage . Took an hour to persuade myself to move far enough to reach the kitchen and retrieve the carving knife . All I could feel was my heart , pounding throughout my body , everywhere . Ba-dum , ba-dum , it was in my chest , my fingers , my toes , everywhere . It eclipsed all the external sounds . I gripped the knife tightly , my thoughts on ... look , I was n't going to hurt him , I 'm not dangerous , I swear ... was just going to threaten him . Just ... threaten him a bit . "
" Felt like it took a week to walk back to his apartment . Pounded on the door a bit harder now , did n't mean to hit it quite so hard . He answered quicker , doubtless thinking the firm , confident-sounding knock to be the fuzz or something .
`` Now 's your turn . Do n't sweat it , Larry . I 'll get you off the hook . Just read this to the Judge and you 'll be in the clear . Trust me , I did n't go to law school for nothing '' "
 We share a nervous laugh . 
" `` Thanks , man . I know sometimes public defenders get a hard rap , but you 've really been a life raft for me . '' The very much actually guilty Larry thanked . "
" Larry approached the judge , armed with a boombox and dope ... err ... no , not that dope . At least not this time . No , only dope *rhymes* today . "
 * '' Ahem . * 
 *You may know me as the drug kingpin . * 
" *But I do n't even know , What is my sin ? * "
" *We all got problems that I can see , man . * "
 *Slingin ' heroine may be Larry 's crime . * 
 *But do n't jail a man while he 's still in his prime . * 
 *I got three kids who need a free man . * 
 *Drop all charges cause crimes ca n't rhyme . `` * 
 
 `` Those were the doppest rhymes I 've heard since '06 . Great job ! '' 
" `` Naw man , you wrote 'em . Thanks so much . '' "
 We share congratulations . 
" Now to work . `` You 're honor , we 'd now obviously like to invoke the Johnnie Cochrane defense and send my client home ! '' "
" Judge Clemetine was a large man with a voice to equal . It bellowed through the courtroom . `` Very well . I was about to hold the defendant in contempt for delivering perhaps the un-dopest lines I 've heard since '06 . Under the Cochrane Rule , the accused shall be pardoned of all crimes comitted *while* defending himself in the courtroom . '' "
" `` Oh shit , oh shit , oh shit . I should 've double checked that . I 'm done forever . Shit . '' I began sweating profusely . "
" The judge continued . `` So therefore , the defendant shall be acquitted of the charge of 3rd degree battery against rap . Now - to reiterate - as we all know , the Cochrane defense only applies to crimes comitted *while* defending oneself in court . So ... moving on to the 17 counts of 1st degree manslaughter , 3 arson charges , 4 counts of interstate ... '' "
" The realization of what had just occured now dawned over Larry . `` I have the worst fucking lawyers . ''
To everyone , "
" We can say I was never right after Mom died , that he death was the start of mine . The weekend drinking gatherings turned into all week drinking binges . I 'm sorry for it all , but that 's not why this letter is here . It 's to remind you all that despite doing nothing to help me , I still love you all . I was the one who had to take care of her arrangements , the one who was there for years , holding myself back so that *someone* was around for her , so she was n't alone when she died . "
" I ca n't stand what everyone had become and drinking was an attempt to escape it all , escape all of you . You all came to me when things started to go downhill for all of you and you expected me to save you from drowning while my head was under the water the whole time . I have n't been that solid rock , that shoulder to cry on , for a very long time . "
 The sad part is no one noticed . 
" But you 'll notice this . It 'll probably be a few days before you do , because none of you call , stop by , or even text , but you 'll notice . I expect it all the crumble for all of you because you could never stand on your own , always relying on Mom or myself to help you , but now that both of us are gone , I hope the worst happens . "

[ Interior , ISIS HQ , Mallory Archer 's office . Sterling is sitting across from his mother with a drink in his hands . ] "
" `` For the last time , Mother , I know the difference between flammable and inflammable ! '' "
" `` There *is* no difference , you idiot ! And try telling that to the Regent Hotel . My God , what you did to that poor- '' "
" `` Mother , he ruined my suit ! '' "
" `` Oh shut up . We 'll talk about your pyrokinetic display in the lobby later , Sterling , I have an important mission for you . '' "
" `` Yeah , and the ... neverer ... the ... better . '' "
 Mallory fidgets with her screen controls . `` Damn this blasted ... CAROL ! '' 
" `` I mean , it was a good suit . '' "
" `` IT 'S CHERYL , AND YOU 'RE NOT MY ... Oh , wait , you kind of are . '' "
 `` I just had it flown in from- '' 
 `` What the hell are you babbling about ? '' 
" `` My name is Cheryl , and I just realised you are my supervisor ? '' "
" `` I 'm talking about my suit , Mother ! '' "
" `` Both of you , SHUT UP ! Carol- '' "
 `` CHERYL ! '' 
" `` Whatever , help me with this ! And Sterling , shut up ! '' "
 `` Feh . '' Sterling knocks back his drink and motions for Carol/Cheryl to refill it . She ignores him . 
" `` See , you 've got ta press ... this one , I think , and then ... this one ... oh , but not that one , it just makes a kind of funny noise . '' "
 `` My God ... I let you use the screen for one night and you mess it up . What in the hell were you watching anyway ? '' 
" [ Jump cut to Mallory 's office , the night before . Cheryl , Krieger , Pam and Rodney are all naked staring at Mallory 's gigantic screen . Horrible gurgling noises are emanating from the speakers . ] "
 `` Oh . My God . '' Cheryl 's hand moves towards her crotch . 
 `` Can we watch something else now ? '' 
" `` Pamela , hush . This is the best part . '' "
 `` Oh for the love of ... how the hell can you even record this shit ? '' 
 Krieger jumps at Pam 's comment . `` Oh . Was I supposed to be recording ? '' 
 [ Cut back to the present . ] 
 `` We were watching some stuff from Krieger 's van . '' 
" Archer scoffs , and takes a sip ( he had to refill his glass himself ) . `` What is it this time , more shock bum fights ? '' "
 `` I swear if I catch that no good clone of Adolf Hitler I will literally disembowel him . '' Mallory imagines herself choking the life out of Dr. Krieger . 
" `` Not literally , Mother , I mean ... oh . I guess you do mean literally . '' "
 `` Aaaaandddd done . '' 
" As Cheryl taps the final key , the screen appears . Sterling 's eyes widen . "
 `` No . '' 
 Sterling stands up and stares at the face on screen . 
 `` No . No no no . '' 
" `` Uh , yes ? '' "
 `` Sterling ? '' 
" `` Mother , you do n't have to say anything . '' Archer pulls his gun out and cocks it dramatically . `` I 'm *in* . '' "
" `` In what ? Sterling , this isn't- '' "
 `` I 'm going to hunt you down like the rat bastard you are ... '' 
" [ We finally see the screen from Sterling 's perspective . The man on screen is James Bond , 007 , MI6 agent . ] "
 `` ... James Bond . '' 
" `` Who , that guy ? Wow he 's hot . Think his hands are any strong ? '' "
" `` It wo n't matter , Carol . '' "
 `` Cheryl ! '' 
 `` Because he 'll be *dead* . '' 
" `` Dead ? Wha-Sterling , you ass , listen to me ! This man is not the job ! '' "
" `` Wha- ? Oh come on , Mother ! '' "
" `` Phrasing , boom ! '' "
" `` Shut up ! And Mother ... .hey , that was a nice one . '' "
" `` I know , right ? '' "
" `` Mother , why would you have his *file* if you were n't going to ask me to kill him ? '' "
" `` You idiot , I was doing a background check ! He 's coming to work for us ! '' "
 Sterling 's eyes widen even more . `` WHAT ? '' 
" `` Ooooh , think his hands are- '' "
" `` Shut up ! Sterling , you-Sterling ... ? '' "
" `` I ... I ... I ca n't ... wha ... '' Archer wobbles , then faints with a crash . Mallory sighs . "
" `` Of course . I get a new Steuben bar set
It *sucks . * "
" I 'm terrified to touch people . Before you ask , no I do not have some kind of mental illness , nor do I have OCD . It 's just that I can see more than people think . How it works is that I touch the person in question and I can see their emotional background . I can see what their brain protects itself from . Their dog dying made a huge impact on them . *Whoop . * I see that kind of thing all the time waiting for my subway train . "
" Sure , some of them are pretty run-of-the-mill things like a pet passing away , a loved one dying , or even the occasional shady dealings with the local loan shark . After a while , it gets easier . Kind of like a filter ; the redundant stuff just blurs together . "
 Then she came . 
" She was a new client who came into my office the other day requesting some kind of graphics project that `` absolutely had to be done yesterday '' and that `` money was no object , just get it done . '' After yelling at my poor secretary Charlene who , bless her heart , put up with her while I got her file all ready for our meeting . "
" `` Mr. Peterson will see you now . Please follow me . '' Charlene said curtly . It was painfully obvious that she was fed up with her , from the sound of her voice . "
" `` God , finally . I 've been waiting *all day* for this . '' "
" After Charlene opened the door to show her in , I took a quick look at her file that her employer sent me a few hours beforehand and shifted my gaze upwards to meet hers . I would be lying if I did n't say that I was shocked . "
" She was *beautiful . * Absolutely gorgeous . She was around five feet , six inches . A full five inches shorter than me . She wore a grey cardigan that sufficiently showed her full breast and a nice pair of matching slacks that seemed to follow a smooth , full curve starting from her waist down to the beginning of her thighs . Trying to pull my eyes away , I shifted my eyes upward and saw her face . Her face had perfect proportions . Piercing gray eyes combined with brown hair made her upper half just as pleasing as her lower half . "
" I gulped : `` Hi , I 'm Scott Peterson . I 'll be handling your project . '' "
 `` Oh it 's nice to meet you ! I 'm Julie . Julie Robson . '' 
" `` Thanks for coming in , Julie . Can we discuss your project ? '' "
 `` By all means . '' 
" We sat down and started a healthy conversation about the project she needed to have done for her boss 's convention coming up soon in the city . As we talked , I noticed that I actually liked her . Was this the same woman I heard screeching to poor Charlene just a few hours before ? No it could n't be . The pearly white teeth that flashed each time she made a quick glance in my direction , the hair tied in a tight bun- "
 `` I 'm sorry my hair 's bothering me . Is it alright with you if I let it down ? '' 
" `` Sure ! I do n't mind . At all . Uhh I mean ... go ahead . '' *Come on do n't screw it up . This is a beautiful woman standing three feet away from you ! Divert all blood away from the other head ! * Julie pulled out a pin and her hair came tumbling down . Oh God , it was like a Pantene commercial . It was almost impossible that a goddess of this caliber would be talking to me . "
 `` Can we continue ? '' said Julie . 
 `` Yeah . '' 
" It was around ten o'clock when we finished discussing her project . Both of us were exhausted . I wanted to know when I would see her again , to enjoy her presence . I know it sounds pretty bad , but I fell pretty hard for Julie . She was perfect . "
 `` Are you sure we 're all done here ? Got all the questions you wanted to ask answered ? '' I asked . 
" She said , `` oh , I still have a few questions . I can wait until tomorrow though . Same time , same place ? '' "
 `` Of course . You know where I sleep . '' I pointed to my office . 
 She giggled . `` Oh stop . I 'm sure you do n't work that hard . I am exhausted . I 'll talk to you tomorrow ! '' 
 She extended her hand for a friendly handshake . Without thinking I reached over and grabbed her hand . It was n't until her memories came flooding into me that I realized what I had done . I did n't want to ruin my perfect idea of her . 
" Her memories were pretty standard . The typical upper-class only child upbringing . Well-off parents who spoiled her , but restrained enough to prevent her from going rotten . Memories of high school and heartbreak . College and new experiences . Study abroad . "
" Then everything went dark . It
“ *ZEEEEEEEETAAAAA ! * ” Yells echoed everywhere around me . Xera , the queen herself , was out looking for the girl , too . Well , I suppose that you ’ d assume she would look for her own daughter . Vengeance light up her eyes , and I knew that whoever had taken the princess would not get off very easily . Usually , when someone went missing , we would wait a day or two to see if they showed up . This time , the Guard was called immediately and a search was started . Someone had taken the princess , and that wasn ’ t a petty , forgettable crime . "
" Ranging up and down the foothills , I could find no tracks of any kind . Quite literally , the kidnappers had left no trail . Possibly , they ’ d run off through the trees , but it seemed unlikely that they could do that carrying the 100 pound princess . Over every hill , there was nothing but the empty forest to greet me and taunt me . No signs of any disturbance . Moreover , the sky was beginning to darken , and the trail would go cold , soon . Lazily drifting , I plodded along the path until I found a tree that looked capable of supporting my weight and providing a comfortable night ’ s rest . Kicking off my shoes , I prepared to climb . Just as I placed my hands on the trunk , I noticed a shining piece of fabric caught in a branch , higher up . Impossible . "
" Half excited , half scared , I climbed the tree . I observed the fabric closely . Gold griffins looked up at me , sewn into the fabric with an expert ’ s hand . Feeling it confirmed that it was silk , and upon a moment ’ s thought I remembered the design on the princess ’ s dress . Excited for the thrill of the chase , I took off to tell the King I ’ d found a clue . During my reckless flight , though , I tripped and crashed into the ground . Catching my breath slowly , I stood up . Blood was everywhere , and I knew none of it was mine . At my feet was the princess .
Without my hoodie on , the fall air stung my arms as I tied the sleeves as tightly as I could around his leg . My white sweatshirt now an eery crimson . "
" `` Hu-hurts . Stop that , it hurts . '' "
" `` Ca n't stop , sorry . Tourniquet . Got ta stop the bleeding . Your femoral artery is cut . '' I say louder than normal so as to be heard over his anguished groans . "
 `` I 'm going to die . '' 
" `` No , you 're not . '' "
" `` Julian , '' He says , defeated . I meet his eyes . "
" `` You 're not going to die . We 're going to get out of here . Hang on , this is going to hurt . '' "
" Holding the sleeves of my hoodie , I yank them tight around his slashed up thigh , effectively turning a jacket into medical equipment . When I do it , he screams a scream like no other I 've ever heard . A scream that reaches out and out and could seemingly be heard for miles . "
 `` You bastard . '' 
" `` I had to , sorry . Put pressure on the wound , like I 'm doing now . Hold on as tightly as you possibly can , and for the love of God , do n't let go . '' "
" `` Where are you going ? '' He pleads , pushing hard to stop the bleeding . "
 `` To flair for the rest of the group . You 're in no shape to hike back to camp . '' 
" `` No ! I told you , it was n't the fall that hurt me ! There 's somebody out there ! I told you , Julian ! They tried to kill me . The rest o the group is dead ! I saw them , I saw them ! We should never have split up- '' "
" `` Hey , Max ! Ssh , it 's okay . That 's just the blood loss and dehydration talking . There 's nobody out there . I 'll be back . '' "
" `` Do n't go , do n't go . '' He says , just as panicked , but weaker . "
" `` Hold on tight , '' I say giving a gesture to his leg . `` And do n't let go . '' "
" With my bag on my shoulder , I make my way away from the overhang Max is laying under , and into the vast woods . It 's painful to leave him like that , but I have no choice . The sun is starting to set , and I need to make it back to Max before dark . Looks the two of us will be spending another night sleeping under that thing , away from camp . Two days since we got lost . One day until any infection that is nestled in Max 's leg could become fatal- if he has n't bleed out by then . "
" `` Dammit . '' I yell out to nobody . It 's just me and my thoughts and the endless , engulfing forest . "
" It 'll be fine , I tell myself . It 'll be fine . I 'll signal the group . they 'll find us by morning , and we 'll all go home . "
" Deeper I trek into the trees , looking for a clearing to shoot up a flair . I do n't make it . "
 The crunch of leaves under feet sneaking up behind me . 
" The sharp , stabbing pain in my neck . "
 The ground beneath my head . 
 Blood warming my back against the cold night . 
 The eyes of a madman . The smile of a killer standing above me . 
 Max was right ...

Ted entered the life office and walked up to the front desk . The 19 year old secretary was ignoring him to face time here soul mate . "
 `` No I love you more '' she said 
 `` No I love you more '' he said 
 `` No I love you more '' she said 
 Ted rang the bell . 
 `` No I love you more '' he said 
 `` No I love you more '' she said 
 `` No I love you more '' he said 
 Ted rang the bell . 
 `` No I love you more '' she said 
 `` No I love you more '' he said 
 `` No I love you more '' she said 
 Ted rang the bell repeatedly . 
" `` No I love you more '' he said , speaking louder "
" `` No I love you more '' she said , also speaking louder "
 Ted picked up the bell and started slamming it into the desk . 
 `` Sorry I have to work '' she said 
 `` Finally '' said Ted 
 `` You hang up first '' he said 
 `` No you hang up first '' she said 
 `` Oh for fuck 's sake '' 
 `` No you hang up first '' he said 
 `` I 'm going in '' 
 Ted walked past the secretary and into the office of the 21 year old CEO of Life Indsutries . He was face timing his soul mate . 
 `` I love you the most '' said the CEO 
 `` No I love you the most '' said his soul mate 
 `` No I love you the most '' said the CEO 
 Ted stewed in silence . 
 `` No I love you the most '' said his soul mate 
 `` No I love you the most '' said the CEO 
 `` No I love you the most '' said his soul mate 
" `` Sorry babe , got ta go , I 've got a customer '' "
 Ted 's spirits rose . 
 `` You hang up first '' said his soul mate 
 And came crashing back down . 
 `` No you hang up first '' said the CEO 
 `` No you hang up first '' said his soul mate 
 `` No you hang up first '' said the CEO 
 `` Ok '' his soul mate hung up . 
 The CEO looked at his phone and laughed . 
" `` What a kidder '' he said , then to Ted `` What can I do for you '' "
" `` Hi , I got my manual for living a long and happy life '' "
 The FaceTime ring tone emanated from the phone . 
 `` No you hang up first '' said his soul mate 
 `` No you… '' 
" Ted leaned across the table , ended the call and held out the open book . "
 `` It just says give'er '' said Ted 
" `` Hm '' said the CEO , taking the book and leafing through page after page that had give'er written in big , bold letters in the middle `` This one does n't just say give'er '' "
 Ted took the book back and read the page . He let the his arms drop to his waist . 
" `` Yeah '' said Ted , turning the book to the CEO `` because instead it says 'just give'er '' "
 `` Well have you tried it ? '' 
 `` What ? '' 
 `` Giving 'er '' 
 `` No because I do n't know what that means '' 
 `` Well it means to…you know…give'er '' 
 `` Give her what ? '' 
 `` No no no give'er…like give'er '' 
 `` You 've just made it less clear '' 
 `` Well you know how you have n't been giving 'er ? Well now start giving 'er '' 
 `` Stop fucking talking and give me another book '' 
" The phone started ringing again . The CEO reached for it but Ted got it first . He flung it across the room where it shattered against the wall . The CEO looked at the broken phone , then back to Ted . He pulled open a drawer and took out another phone , which he put on his desk . The CEO stared at it for a second , adjusted it a centimetre to the left then looked at Ted . "
 `` I 'm afraid we ca n't '' 
 `` Why ? '' 
 `` Every book is personalized . If we gave you a book someone would go without one '' 
 `` I 'm going without one '' 
 The CEO furrowed his brow `` You have one though '' 
 `` A fucking useless one '' 
 `` I think it 's solid advice '' 
 `` You think give'er is solid advice ? '' 
" `` Yeah . Look at me , I 'm 21 I 'm a CEO , I 've met my soul mate… '' "
 On cue the phone started ringing . Ted picked it up and tossed it over his head . It landed in the water pitcher by the door . 
" `` And if I could sum up what I did down to
It was a dull tuesday morning when I woke up to the sounds of my phone going off non-stop . Aaron was frantically screaming nonsense at me . `` THERE IS A NUMBER ... Errr ... SOMETHING IS ON ME JOSH ! '' I mumbled and turned on my side to go back to my dreams , but that is when I saw it . There in the mirror , it was right on top of me . A shiny green **1** . I thought I was seeing things , I **had** to still be dreaming ! I reached up and tried to touch it , but nothing was there to feel . My shaking hand pierced through the number and it stayed exactly where it was . <newline> I showered to clear my head and let the brisk water wash away the thoughts of this mysterious symbol above my dome . What did it mean anyways ? Then it happened . A loud crack and mumble that seemed to fill the air . The water stopped . All I could do is stand there , naked and sopping wet . I just wished it would all go away ! Why me ? And what about Aaron too ? I sprinted through my apartment to reach my phone . I dialed as fast as I could , but the lines were dead now . What was happening ! ? I have to go find him . <newline> Everything outside is hectic ! Everybody is running around with no idea what to do . *8,724 500 153,475 28* I tried to see the pattern but there was nothing . I hopped on my bike to find Aaron , but not before seeing it . **The red number** . I tried to clear it from my head but it was all I could think about . **Number 1,356,752** . I only got a glimpse , but the second I saw him , I knew something was off . I got to Aaron 's , and to my excitement , he was completely alright . **Number 64,814** . He would n't stop staring at my **1** , but he knew nothing more than I did . A helicopter flew by with loud speakers screaming to `` GET TO THE STADIUM : AVOID THE RED AT ALL COSTS . '' *Avoid the red* It buzzed through my head a million times . We packed up some clothes and headed to the stadium with no idea what to do . <newline> 29 days passed by as the green numbers got lower . I was in charge , I was number 1 . The red seemed to tear a person apart , that is , if you count them as a person anymore . Every second , **1,000** people went red . It was sad watching those who had numbers in the millions go , counting down to those of us on the low end . By my calculations , I had about 81 days from the day I was chosen , until I went red . Aaron was still with me , but his time was on its way . The clock was ticking . <newline> 7 days remain . We are thinking about zoning people off , but I just ca n't leave him . Our day is coming and my best friend is only going to change a minute before me . Our quarantine zone is falling to pieces with the reds pounding the walls to get in . The top 10 have been meeting to eradicate the problem , but these are our friends ! 3 and 8 were in a heated debate about whether to start killing them off or not . `` WHO CARES 8 ! They are red and they are staying that way ! You remember the zoning mishap for the 39,506,000 's do n't you ? '' `` How could anyone forget , they had n't turned yet bu- '' `` THE REDS TORE THEM TO SHREDS ! These are savages out there . '' `` We do n't know if there is an end to this or no- '' `` There is an end . '' I interjected . The entire room silenced . `` We ARE the end . We all have known this since the day we saw the countdown . '' It was then when 2 stepped in . Her voice filled the room sounding like an angel , speaking the words of the devil . `` We are dying . The walls are crumbling . What is left for us to do ? What happens when we kill them off ? '' 6 could barely sit still he was shaking so much . I looked around the room , 9 unfamiliar faces who had become my family . I cared about them , but how much longer could that last . `` Our friends are out there . Our families too ! Who cares if we live another 7 days . We have to put them to rest . That is the risk that I am willing to take , but if you are n't , sit pretty under your little number . It is time to take our Earth back , no matter the cost . '' Everything froze . <newline> 10 was the only one moving . He gave me a little slow clap and a *bravo* . He began to circle the table in his luxurious pinstripe suit , but everybody else was stuck in place . He reached 9 and with a little flick , turned her number **red** . `` You could n't have possibly thought you were the real *number 1* could you ? '' I tried to utter out a cry , but I was paralyzed . Who is he ? He went down the line and stopped at each person . `` 8 ,
It always puzzled me , to say the least , and made me extremely nervous . "
" As such I never committed into relationships , probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated . "
" My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply , Indy . He was the complete opposite of me : extraverted , charming , outgoing . He was friend with everyone , but still reliable and generous . "
" We stayed together for a couple of years , and , I do n't know why , but it really seemed like he had feelings for me . "
" But like I did in other relationships before , I shut him down , rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much . "
" In the end he left me , like they all did . I learned later that he was with Kelly , a girl we met a couple of time when we were together . "
" I met other men and women , and it always ended the same way . "
" Fast forward to yesterday . Kelly calls me , saying that Indy was in the hospital , after being hit by a car . His condition was critical , and he has asked for me . "
" And here I am , a bouquet of flowers in hands , nervously looking for room 68 . "
" I find it , half opened , and take a deep breath to give myself courage , and here Indy 's weak voice . "
" `` Kelly , you 're ... a wonderful girl but ... I ... I ... I never loved you . '' "
" The words hit me like a punch . I storm in the room , but his eyes are already closed . Forever .
It was n't like I wanted it to happen , hell , it was n't even that I knew it would happen..it just did ! "
" Our society has labeled my ilk as `` Defects '' ; while the majority of our race has evolved into a species with extraordinary powers , the rest of us ( the defects ) just do stupid shit like turn into bread , or have a golden anus . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not judging my comrades here its just that we 're not all that special , at least not special enough to require around the clock supervision by our government friends . "
" So why am I writing this and why are you reading this right now ? The answer for both is the same , you 're wondering why the sky is always dark and food is nearly non-existent ! For that , I truly am very sorry and I hope after you 've finished reading this that you will forgive me and Charles . "
" It all started in 10th grade , when our powers `` awaken '' for the first time . Yes , just like puberty we not only begin to judge others but ourselves as well . After classmate after classmate was isolated in a glass room and taught how to bring forth their newly found abilities I was left in awe by what I might be able to do ! "
" Then my turn came , I stood in the middle with my hand in front of my face to protect my eyes from the heat and brightness of the massive spotlight shined onto my face . I was injected , electrocuted and made to wait for two minutes before the voice overhead instructed me to 'concentrate , focus on the beating of your heart . Count the beats and when you feel as though you 're going to pass out I want you to exhale '' . "
" So I did , I counted the beats and I exhaled like they asked me too ... .but nothing happened ! Nothing shook , nothing moved , I did n't float hell I did n't even turn into toast . Then I heard the screams , through that thick glass I heard the blood curdling screams of my classmates and I knew something bad just happened . "
 When the door opened and I saw the nurse the look of horror on her face filled me with dread . You could tell she shit herself by what I had done and I mean that literally . Her uniform from the waist down was now brown and the stench perforating into my bubble of seclusion let me know she was n't the only one . 
" I took a walk of shame that still haunts me to this day in my dreams . All of my classmates , the principle even the security guards were leaking bodily fluids and trying their best to conceal what had happened to them . "
" So I went about my life avoiding as many people as possible , if I lost my focus for even a moment everyone around me would evacuate their bowls in a painful and torrent way . I tried to think of any use my skill could have and besides being a walking laxative I really could n't come up with any respectful and useful way for me to use my powers . Neither did the government as from 10th grade on I was provided my very own security guard , who happened to be sponsored by Depends . "
 Everything in my life was in seclusion until the day I fell ill and needed to stay at the hospital overnight . The nursing staff and doctors were screened before treating me and their name tags comprised of a post it note stuck onto those stupid tree shaped car fresheners . 
" The last night I was their , the last night most people remember of normalcy actually come to think of it . Well that was the night maintenance was replacing the faucets in the bathrooms with new touch-less ones . "
" Enter Charles , a burly man no more older than I . His real name I soon found out was not really `` Charles '' but since he was an illegal from Canada ( borders were shut down after we evolved remember ? ) he changed his name to protect himself and get a fake social security number . "
" Anyways Charles enters the room and startles me , so much so that I lose control of my focus and cause him to shit himself . I attempt to apologize but am shocked to see him stripping off his clothes as they themselves go up in flames ! He confides that his ability is , in his words `` I dun turn shit to napalm '' . "
" Now at first we thought it was kind of funny , he ca n't go into public restrooms while others are using them for fear of starting someones asshole on fire . I ca n't be around people without worrying I 'm going to make them shit themselves . Together we 're just , bad karma I guess . "
" Everything seemed to be going ok , both of us had our abilities ( if you want to call them that ) under control . That is until we heard the fire alarms going off . For whatever reason , our powers were magnified and constantly active as soon as we both triggered them in each others presence ! It did n't take long for the screaming to start and by the time we made our way outside we saw the ring of fire spreading rapidly . "

Captain Rick slammed on the brakes of his moon rover , and skidded to a stop for the next 10 seconds . "
 Once the rover stopped completely he stood up and headed over to the object glinting a few meters away from him . 
" As he got closer the brightness became more and more unbearable , until he managed to cover the object with his shadow . "
" He blanched at the sight , murmuring a soft `` What in the actual fuck ... '' before hurriedly reaching for his radio button . "
" Finally , after a few seconds of struggling with his suit , he called the colony , and said the words he never in his life thought he would utter . "
 <newline> . 
" `` Uhm , HQ , this is captain Rick , I ... Uhm.. found a viking sword ... over ? ''
I questioned my choice on that first day , and on several subsequent days . By the time summer came around , I was enjoying it of course . But then autumn came again , and fat clouds brought more questions . "
" I always walked my section of the Thames , never any other , not even on my own time . The filthy serpent that snakes through London had never interested me , and still does n't . I passed through Rotherhithe Docks and paused , the rain falling around me in sheets , splashing off a nearby awning with a roar . I recall this now , because it was the last good day . Every day since has been horrific due to my own curiosity . "
" The other Regulators had said not to ask questions when I transferred over from the Environmental Department . As far as cushy government jobs went , this was the best . So secretive , you ca n't even tell yourself what you do . Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard every time the heavens open , and record all 'strangeness ' you see in the waters . Post the form in the box and go home . "
" Some days , like this day , the wind was not strong enough to move the mist from the murky surface , and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies . Never get too close , they said . I stared at a dark twist in the current and hunched deeper into my raincoat . I checked boxes on my waterproof sheet . "
" I saw Ben Thompson slowly go mad . That was when I had first begged my superiors for the answers . They laughed as if we were sharing a joke but then threatened my job , and I have a family . So then I asked some of the other Regulators , even though I knew we were not supposed to fraternise outside of work . Blank faces and sullen looks . These folks knew their ebb from their flow , but never more than that . Just like me . "
" I threw my legs over the barrier and landed knee deep in brown slime . My hood slipped and my hair immediately plastered to my face in the deluge . 'Never get too close , they said ' , I murmured as I waded to the water 's edge , past sunken shopping carts and drowned sea birds . "
" Never get too close . Never ask questions . Two rules , both broken . I learned that when you see it for the first time , you will always see it . The clamour beneath the chaotic surface . Dark shades of fingers and translucent twists of limbs . The long dead fighting for a return to civilisation . The rain brings them up like worms , out of their watery graves . Gasping for air but never quite reaching it . "
" Since that day , I see them . And the London rain stinks .
**This was a great prompt , but I kind of took it in a different direction** "
" It started with one long slow note , <newline> Was apprehensive at the start , <newline> With confidence the note grew bolder , <newline> Adding harmonies to its heart , "
" As song took shape more voices joined , <newline> ‘ Till the village was filled with song , <newline> And I alone ignored its pleading , <newline> I had no voice to sing along , "
" I looked down on the songs and dancing , <newline> My lip curled with righteous scorn , <newline> “ What childishness this frivolous drear , <newline> Too carefree for one wellborn , ” "
" As hours passed the song had changed , <newline> For with each precious moment , <newline> A fresh new song had been arranged , <newline> Thus began my painful torment , "
" For I alone could hear no song , <newline> Nor the cadence in the dance , <newline> Nor the words with which the village crooned , <newline> To lovers locked in their romance , "
" A different song for love or weeping , <newline> For ending conflicts long hard-fought , <newline> Though animals with growls and peeping , <newline> Could hear the Song , I alone could not , "
" I begged my ears to hear the sound , <newline> My voice to produce a single note , <newline> Yet heard no Song and no note found , <newline> The lines I was unable to quote , "
" Desperate now with tears and pleading , <newline> Arms stretched skyward , knees shorn and bleeding , <newline> “ From whence came these tragic proceedings , <newline> That I alone , of upright breeding , <newline> Should falter at the call ? ” "
" And yet no answer to my anguished cry , <newline> I bid a deaf singing town good-bye , <newline> The tallest mountain to catch my eye , <newline> I climbed ‘ till I was weak with panting , "
" “ What life is this ? ” My mind obsessed , <newline> “ That I alone should be music-less , <newline> The dancing feats others posses , <newline> Should stop short when it reaches me ? ” "
" Though two days passed , uncomprehended , <newline> My food ran out , my journey ended , <newline> I slowly stood up , and then descended , <newline> To return to the start of my misery , "
" My footsteps slow , my eyes unseeing , <newline> For deep within in all my being , <newline> I knew that I was alone . "
" The dreaded sound heard over the hill , <newline> Every footstep a challenge of will , "
" *But as I drew nearer the sound was , different , * "
" Not playful as it was when I ’ d departed , <newline> Nor cheerful , or melodious at all , <newline> Instead the song was full of anguish , <newline> It sounded nothing like what I recalled , "
" I ran until my heart was bursting , <newline> The sight of my town set me to cursing , <newline> My friends in rags yet still rehearsing , <newline> Spurred on by some devilish call , "
" Though exhausted the people noticed , <newline> When I ran in through the main gate , <newline> Their eyes looked up , expressions hopeful , <newline> That I would save them from this fate , "
" For in my absence they had learned , <newline> That not a one occurrence could pass , <newline> Without a jig , or dancing circle , <newline> Without a chorus to sing en masse , "
" All this they sang beseechingly <newline> “ And so it is , ” They sang to me , <newline> “ One such as you could say and be , <newline> Instead of us , then we ’ d be free ” "
" Hopelessly I watched them wander , <newline> Their choreographed dances and trills , <newline> And one by one they joined the yonder , <newline> Till I was alone on the hill , "
" My bitterness had reached crescendo , <newline> As I watched the last one drift away , <newline> Why should they be graced easy passing , <newline> While I alone was forced to stay ? "
 
 
 
 
 
 
" <newline>
There was always so much talk . Big words for big hypotheticals , bravado and overconfidence in the face of imaginary monsters . But what good is talk in the face of the first screams ? "
 Amazing how quickly those tuff words soon too become screams . 
" It started with the sirens . Crowds slowly gathered outside of their homes to watch the local police force empty the town without warning . `` Protect and serve . '' All talk . The sheep dogs attempted to rouse a militia , thinking the revolution was nigh . The cowards hid in their cellars.. the lucky bastards got to leave early . Others stood idol , either in defense of their homes and lives , or simply waiting for a reason . "
" Most called their kin , hoping their last thoughts were love . "
" No one expected the reason . From afar it could have been a wayward traveler on his way to the hills , until others gathered behind . Oh but the weaponry was too small , knives , clubs , tools of labor , could hardly defend against the hoards . Even the re-slain posed a threat , festering pestilence into the air and sickening those nearby . "
" Soon the roads were useless , choked with traffic and the pained screams of panic and failure . The strong turned their hearts to hardness , raiding the weak for their supplies . Safe havens activated their defenses against the double threat of attack , and fear . There was no need to leave anyway , there would be no escape from the threat . "
" Within one day , the roads were quiet . Those who did n't die remained hidden , or silent behind their arms . The main sources of supplies were all occupied or raided . There was no din of raid , nor chaos of fire . Whatever remained of humanity had finally lost its superficiality , and worked only to protect it from the threat . "
" For the only means of stopping war , is with greater warfare . And all mankind becomes united against inhumanity . For now , sin takes on life , manifested in the resurrected bodies of the slain . "
" For all man are kin , where death is succession . None were left now to talk , the liars and screamers are on the other side .
I checked my phone for the third time . No responses . I 'd tried it all : prompts about the devil , prompts about Hitler . Nothing . <newline> A thought poked like a meerkat out of my subconscious . <newline> `` No , '' I said aloud . `` That 's crazy . Unless ... '' <newline> I walked to the coffee shop , trying to make eye contact with someone . Nothing . When I arrived , I opened the door and strode to the counter . The girl at the counter did n't notice . <newline> `` Hello ? '' Nothing . <newline> `` She ca n't see you , '' said a gravelly voice . <newline> I turned . The voice belonged to a man who wore a tailored suit and looked like Tom Waits . <newline> `` Oh God . It 's you . '' <newline> `` Funny , '' he chuckled . `` Now you 're the devil , but only people who believe in you can see or hear you . What are you going to do ? '' <newline> `` I wonder if Reddit has any good ideas about this . ''

 Part I : How it all Started 
" “ I guess you can say , well it happened a long , long time ago. ” "
" “ Shut up old man , can ’ t you see I ’ m trying to read the damn Journal ? ” "
" That idiot lawyer , at least I think he ’ s a lawyer , rides this part of the line , between Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street every day . At least I think he gets on at Pennsylvania . I can ’ t be sure ; I don ’ t wake until Franklin . "
" “ Every damn day , you try to tell me that blasted old story . The year is 2017 ; get in the habit of living in it , bum. ” "
" He says something like that every day . All I try to do is say hello , and the rat goes off on me . I ’ ve tried to tell my story ; no one believes me . That story is what landed me here , on this blasted old underground rail system . They think I ’ m crazy ; they never saw my partners . <newline> Of course , I ought to describe myself a bit . The rat race may think I ’ m crazy by talking to myself , but screw them . They put me here . Anyways , it ’ s been a while since I ’ ve actually looked in a mirror . Years since I ’ ve gone through the trouble of comprehending what was there . I figure I look a bit like the idiot in that ‘ Aqualung ’ song . Damn limeys , can ’ t keep an empire , but sure can write a great song . Of course , I am just assuming this . Hell , I could still be handsome and buff like in my youth ; but that , my friend , would be crazy . "
" As usual I sit on the bench in the rail car with my hands in my face . Nobody needs to look at me ; they had they ’ re damn chance . But today , something odd happened . A young girl , probably just into high school , came up to me . "
" “ Excuse me sir , but is the seat next to you taken ? ” "
" “ Screw off , girl . I don ’ t need you here. ” "
" She turned her nose up , and I expect a few tears dripped from her eye . It ’ s still better than landing the night in jail ; been there , done that . "
" I got off at the next station , and proceeded to a bench , off in the corner of the terminal . I tend to keep to myself , if at all possible . I sat down , and put my face in my hands once more , robotically , it seemed . It ’ s just what I ’ m accustomed to . "
" I must have dozed off , seeing as when I woke up , that damn girl was sitting next to me . "
" “ Sir , what in the hell is your problem ? ” "
" I looked her square in the eye and said , “ In my day , women didn ’ t swear. ” "
" “ Well your day is past , old man . You get snarky with me , I ’ ll be the same with you. ” "
" “ I ’ m an educated man , lady . I went to school for eight years . Be more respectable. ” "
 “ Why should I when you won ’ t be to me. ” 
" Of course , of course . Kids these days . Damn feminist movement , taking the spotlight away from *my* movement . Women running the nation ? *I should be ruling the world ! * "
" “ Alright , little girl . What do you want ? I hope not money , I certainly don ’ t have that. ” "
 “ I want to hear your story. ” 
" “ You little belligerent , you can ’ t handle my story. ” "
" “ Sir , you used the word ‘ belligerent ’ wrong. ” "
" “ Depends on your perspective , ” "
" “ Seriously , you may not have noticed me , but I ’ ve been ‘ progressively researching ’ you for awhile . I know your name , for a matter of fact . It ’ s Roger Carson. ” "
" Little wench knows her shit . I suppose I could tell her my story… <newline> “ I ’ m sorry , I ’ m all told out. ” "
" “ Carson , I know you have never told your side of the story. ” "
 “ Why sure I have ! I tell myself it every day ! ” 
" “ Look Carson , the police reports are vague . I may be young , but I can already tell that the reports were spot on about you being impotent. ” "
 I feel enraged from that accusation . But she ’ s right .

`` I never really was welcome here ... was I ? '' `` Jim , that 's not true . '' Lyte said . You just ca n't stay here anymore . I wish things did n't go down like this . '' Jim shook his head . `` You did n't want me here . I could feel it . '' Lyte looked at Jim , with an impassioned face , and held traces of concern . `` Feel what ? '' Jim laughed , an outburst that seemed to shake the small cabin . `` Feel the animosity. `` Lyte sighed . `` that was n't animosity . That was not an emotion borne of anything other than fear . You ca n't stay here , I wish you could , but you ca n't . You damn well know why . '' "
" footsteps approached the cabin fit snugly for one person . The door shuttered , and twinged , the bolts connected to the wood , and Ann stepped forward . Before even reading their faces she bemoaned in a breathe held out of running , dropped four pieces of wood , and cussed out , `` Their coming . The rats ... they were heading north ... that means , well , you know who follows them . '' "
" Jim dropped the clay cupping of his soup bowl . Lyte ran to the door , and Ann screamed this time , `` Their coming ! ''
`` Water ? '' he asks , a slight nervous chuckle escaping his lips , `` You can control water ? '' I smile , he thinks he 's saved . `` You ca n't hurt people with water . What are you going to do ? Splash us to death ? '' "
" He thinks that because I do n't have a weapon , because my great power is hydrokinesis , that they 're safe . But they are n't safe , these are the kinds of people who spent years , decades mocking me because I could n't manipulate earth or fire , I could n't lift buildings or call down thunderstorms . Just water , good ol ' H2O , what could anyone do with water ? Not everyone is born with superpowers but out of those of us who are , I was born with the useless one . I could n't be a superhero with water . They broke me down , they cast me away like trash because , at the end of the day , I 'm too different to live a normal life and too weak to be a hero . But now who 's laughing ? Water is patient , in weathers away at mountains and creates vast canyons , it breaks down human achievement and one wave can bring entire countries to their knees . Most of all , water is life . 70 % of the Earth is water and 60 % of the human body is water . I can control 60 % of every single human on this planet and I can make them scream . "
" It started off small , rodents and household pets that I could torture and break . So small and defenceless that they never had a chance to fight back , at the end of the day that is all these people are , rodents that walk on two legs . I can still hear them laughing , all of them , even now as they sit here before me , they 're laughing at me . I can see it in their eyes , they do n't fear me , they think I 'm weak , they think they 're safe . They think that once they 're in school , hidden behind their walls and cowering behind their teachers , that they 're safe from me . But this was the perfect place to begin , I will make the world understand who I am from here . I will climb over their broken corpses , their mutilated remains and I will watch their world burn . "
" He 's still talking , laughing and mocking behind his eyes . Or is he . Did he even open his mouth in the first place ? Wait ... who IS talking ? Am.. I ... . ? No . They 're still laughing at me , everywhere , all the time , all around me , echoing through the hallways and classrooms . It is time they learnt who I really am . I raise a shaking hand towards one of the teachers while staring out into the crowd to see that maniacal laughing turn to dread . The first thing I see of it is the puddle that begins to form at his feet and spread out across the floorboards , the wave of people trying to get away from the horror unfolding before them . Finally , I look towards him and gaze upon my handiwork , water is dripping out of every orifice and hole in his body . Small waterfalls falling out from his eye sockets , mouth and nose and cascading down to the floor . His screams begin to echo out from the back of his throat and through the chamber as his skin dries up and his body starts to shut down . Eventually , his body falls to the ground and he lifelessly lies there in the pool of water , urine and blood that has formed on the floor . They stare at him silently for a second before all hell breaks loose , students and teachers sprinting everywhere in a desperate attempt to escape , some trying to push past me and many going down like their professor . Another few suffer the instant dehydration , I drown others , one or two explode in blood as I punch through their skin with the water . "
" I stare at the corpses , spread out all around me , their blood and water creating a small lake throughout the hall . For just a minute , I hang around and just enjoy the carnage I created , sirens ringing in the distance as the police rush to try and stop me . They 'll learn soon enough that they ca n't stop me , they 're going to need much more than guns to stop me now . This is a world filled with heroes from New York to Japan and everywhere in between , it turns out that I 'm the villain . "

The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope , and after he lost sight of it he heard it , crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain . "
" He dropped to his knees , too exhausted to put the scream that was in his heart out into the world . Every part of his body ached . His broad muscles were impressive , but were not built for the task at hand . No human was built for such a task . And although the wretched man had always known that , it had never stopped him from trying it again . The only way out of this hell was to play the game ; the boulder at the top of this mountain became his light at the end of the tunnel . "
" He started his way down the hill , his calloused feet carrying him down the rough terrain . He could barely remember the life that existed before this one . Was he a king ? Was he a slave ? All images of the past were replaced by ones of the mountain . The gods had forsaken him to this pointless task , erasing every part of him that existed before and replacing it with this image , this blood metronome . Every roll of the rock was another strike of a massive clock that counted down the minutes to nothing , and served only as a tool that others could look towards as example . "
" After hours of excruciating labor , Sysiphus moved the rock to the top of the mountain . The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope , and after he lost sight of it he heard it , crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain .
I was a teacher of electronics in my dream , but that is too far away from where I woke up . I would n't be able to dumb it down enough if I tried . "
" When I woke , it turns out I am actually only 7 years old , celebrating my birthday one Christmas morning , even though my dream seemed as if I was in my mid 30 's . I was pretty good at most disciplines in Science and Math , even gifted really , but a genius I am not . "
" My memories from the dream have faded just a bit , but not all of them . I remember the simple equations . I was good enough at math to even prove them if I new them , but I would have never figured them out on my own . "
" One day it will be just a legend . An example given in the text books , but when the apple hit me on the head , it reminded me of the gravity formula from my dreams . And then it all flooded back . "

 I spend my free time trying to remember the chemistry I knew to see if I can make my brain dream again . People here call it alchemy and I have to be careful not to get caught knowing too much . 
" I remembered that in my dream I liked codes , so I taught myself numerology and hid it throughout my works . I hope to pass a code to my future self . "

`` ... .Now to just fix that semicolon , carry the one , add in the null set ... and ... Eureka ! I 've done it ! I 've proven God 's existence ! '' "
" *A shadowy figure , who had been lurking in the corner for the last five minutes , clapped slowly for about 7.6 seconds , give or take . * "
" `` Hello John . I hear that you 've discovered proof of the existence of God , '' said the shadowy figure . "
 `` Indeed I have ! This is a momentous occasion ! '' John exclaimed . He had been working on this proof for years . 
 `` I 'm going to have to ask you to destroy it . '' 
 `` Like hell I will . '' 
" `` Indeed . Satan discovered proof of my existence too , and look what that got him . '' The shadowy figure stepped into the light . Gaudily bright white clothes sparkled in the dimly lit room . This guy had the figure of a septuagenarian marathon runner and a beard to rival the first Albus Dumbledore . "
" `` Cosplaying as God , I take it ? '' "
" `` You 've discovered proof of my existence , I mysteriously popped out of a corner , and you 've told nobody about this yet . For a genius , you 're a fool . '' "
" `` While I have proven God 's existence , you are not him . '' "
 `` I can make the whole planet rain for 40 days if you like . '' 
 `` I bet you can . '' 
 `` I 'm not kidding . '' 
 `` I do n't doubt it . '' 
 `` I have unbelievable powers . '' 
 `` I do n't doubt it . '' 
 `` Your password is hunter42 . '' 
" That took John by surprise , as he did n't know that you could pronounce asterisks that way . Surely this being was powerful and knowledgeable . "
" `` I know . Look 'God , ' you may be more powerful than me . You may be more factually retentive than I am . But the fact of the matter is that not only did I discover proof of God 's existence , but I discovered against your wishes . '' "
 `` Fine . The jig is up . I 'm neither all-powerful nor all-knowing . But you 're giving me that proof . '' 
 `` No . '' 
 `` No ? ! '' 
" `` I 've proven an omniscient , omnipotent God . You may be a powerful alien , but you are n't God . '' "
 John thought for just a second more . 
" `` Besides , If you were able to stop me , you would n't be asking . '' "
" The glimmering figure , seeing that all hope in the conversation was lost , materialized a green portal and walked away . "
" `` You make a good point , John . Goodbye then . '' "

" Loretta screamed . She grabbed the shower curtain and tore it from its hooks , wrapping it around her body . The shower continued to run and the water bounced off the pale yellow curtain and onto the white tile floor . Steam spread throughout the room . "
 `` WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU ? '' Loretta stepped out of the shower and onto the wet floor . 
" `` Alpha , Omega , I am he who is called I am , you know the dri- '' GOD stopped as HE saw Loretta slip , she fell onto the edge of the shower tub and her neck bent unnaturally . HE sighed , pointed at her , and she rose up as if pulled by strings . With a snap of HIS finger , her neck returned to its proper position . "
" `` Loretta Jones , 32 years old , assistant finance manager at Brunk & Spurlock , has never lived farther than 25 miles from her hometown of Sacramento , California , dreams of one day meeting Peter Falk , I am your creator . '' "
" She brought her hands to her mouth as her feet returned to the tile floor , the water giving a quiet splash . "
" `` Tell me , Loretta , what were you just thinking about ? '' "
" `` Umm , nothing . Nothing at all . '' "
 HE smiled . 
 `` How often do you think about nothing ? '' 
" `` Pretty often , I guess . '' "
" `` Loretta , what would you do if I told you that you think about nothing more than anyone I 've ever met before ? '' "
" `` I guess I 'd be inclined to believe you , sir . '' "
 HE laughed . 
" `` I 'm going on vacation , going to spend a few weeks as a capybara . I need someone to take over , someone who truly understands how the universe works . Ca n't let Jesus do it , he 'd cure diseases and - trust me - they serve some purpose . Momo would give everyone raisins , and Sidd would end suffering . I need someone like you , after all omnipotence means anything you think of instantly comes true . '' "
 `` What are you asking me ? '' 
" `` If I needed you to think of nothing until I returned , would you do that favor for me ? '' "
" Loretta 's quivering hand fell from her mouth and swung up to her forehead , a soggy post-shower salute . "
" `` Good ! '' HE said and in an instant HE was no longer , and where HE disappeared the steam swirled . Loretta grabbed her hot pink towel and waddled to the living room . Her husband was cooking in the kitchen , the loud vent fan was running on high . "
 `` Were you singing in there ? I could hear you halfway across the house . '' 
" `` I met God himself , he gave me infinite power and knowledge for an indiscriminate amount of time . '' "
 `` Oh . Do you want one scoop of bolognese sauce or two ? ''

Fond memories came to me in dream-like visions as I held my mother 's hand . The steady rhythm of the machines that were struggling to keep her alive faded away . In its place , I heard my scampering footsteps through the kitchen and smelled the sweet , salty aroma of freshly baked cookies . My mother , much younger , stood in front of a piping hot oven in her cooking garb . Carefully she carried the cookies to a waiting tray to cool before quickly swatting my hand as I moved to steal a molten morsel . The scene skipped ahead to us sharing a cookie at the table , it was beginning to cool as was my mother 's hand . "
" “ Hey , ” I said , gently shaking my mother 's shoulder as the vision broke . “ Hey , would you tell me how you used to make those cookies ? ” "
" “ What ? ” she asked weakly . “ Of all things , why now ? ” "
" “ Because that 's how I remember you best , ” I replied with tears in my eyes . "
" “ Hmm , ” she said , turning her head away from me . She continued thinking for a time as coughs rattled her thin frame . “ No . I think it 's best that we let it die with me , son. ” "
" “ But-why ? ! ” I replied , shaking my head fiercely in disagreement . I was surprised by just how much this meant to me . “ Everyone loved your cookies ! I loved making them with you and sharing them with you , do n't you remember- ” "
" “ Now , you know I do , ” she interrupted with a reassuring pat on the back of my hand . "
" “ Please , mom ” I pleaded . “ It 's all I want . Share with me one last time. ” "
" “ Alright , but do n't say I did n't warn you , ” she relented as she struggled to turn her body towards me . “ Grab that pad and pen there and get to writing. ” "
" “ Okay , ” I said , hastily scooping the items from her bedside stand as she broke into another fit of coughing . This time it was productive . Her hands were stained red as I watched in horror . “ Mom- ” "
" “ Listen up , I 'm only going to get to tell you once before I croak , ” she said in her old tone with a slight smile on her haggard face . “ You 'll want 2 cups flour , not that self-rising stuff . The all-purpose kind . A quarter of a teaspoon of salt . Go fine on that one . I know you like your coarse salt . Oh , and keep it table . I never cared for that sea salt . Now , this last ingredient is the most important , have you kept up with me so far ? ” "
" “ Yes , ma'am , ” I said as I furiously scribbled her every word . "
" “ Good . You 're going to want a human heart , ” she continued . “ Get it as fresh as you can now , those stale hearts make the cookies go south in a hurry . There 's just something about the consistency and taste of a good , fresh heart . You ca n't beat 'em. ” "
" “ Mm-hmm , okay , ” I said to myself as I wrote down her words without question , without thought . She settled down on her back once again as her breathing slowed . I did n't notice as I read over my notes . Something seemed a little off to me . The noises in the background began to die out as she took her final breath . I saw her chest rise and fall for the final time on the edges of my vision as I reached that last line . “ Hey ! Wait ! You ca n't go ! You did n't tell me how to prepare it ! ” "
 Her chest fell still and she said no more . 
" “ No ! I 'll never know what temperature to bake them on or how long they 're supposed to cook , mama ! ” I cried as I cradled her in my arms . Our greatest family recipe was forever lost to me . "

Yeah , my childhood was pretty normal . When Adam was born it took some getting used to the fact that I 'd be getting less Christmas presents , but I loved my brother from the start . My father was an architect and my mom was a high profile defense attorney . They both worked long hours , but they made time for us whenever they could . Oh yeah , we had a babysitter for a few years there that I slowly figured out never aged . She was perpetually sixteen years old . It was pretty weird , but I got used to it . I had the biggest crush on her . Anyway , in high school I ended up playing varsity badminton . Adam played the tuba . I graduated with decent grades and now here I am in college following in my father 's footsteps .
I was nine years old for my first . Most people have trouble remembering the events of a week ago and yet that day twenty-three years past is still so fresh in my mind . "
" I can picture it , the skin peeled back , the muscles underneath clenching and unclenching . My parents had gotten me a sewing kit for my birthday , perhaps in the hope of focusing me on something productive . The needles I had kept , and the string . The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh . Blood pooled , like a stagnant well . But it smelled of power , and it fascinated me . "
" I sat for a while , watching my work . Seeing the muscles move , the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird . The beast ’ s eyes rolled in its head , endlessly . And I watched . "
" Its death was of no great interest to me . The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did . When it was over I cleaned my tools , even then I had been tidy , systematic . The body I hid , deep in the woods . I visited it often , reminiscing , remembering . The surge of power I felt faded each day , and I wanted more . "
" My dog had been my first . And as you know officer , it was not my last . <newline>
The Impala 's engine throbbed through the streets of Culpepper , Virginia . It was a quaint , sleepy little town in the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains that had been disturbed by the gruesome murder of a young teenage training to be a lifeguard at the local country club pool . "
" `` Sucked *dry* , '' Sam read from the article , scrunching up his face in disgust at the description . `` And the CPR dummy was nowhere to be found . '' "
" Dean pulled into the parking lot of the motel and turned off the engine . `` So , what ? Succubus , you think ? '' "
" Sam shrugged . `` The body fits , but why would a succubus steal a CPR dummy ? And besides , there 's nothing to indicate that the kid had sex before he died . The article probably would have mentioned it if he was found nude and handcuffed to a bed or whatever . '' "
" Dean smirked . `` Yeah , that 's the way to go ... '' Sam rolled his eyes and got out of the car to go check in . "
 -- -- -- 
" `` How 'd the FBI get wind of this one ? '' the coroner asked as she led the way back to cold storage . Sam and Dean , wearing dapper black suits , tucked their phony IDs back into their breast pockets and followed behind her . `` Is n't this a little outside of your jurisdiction ? '' "
 `` It 's ... uhh ... '' Dean was always bad at coming up with this kind of stuff . 
" `` Part of a federal investigation into faulty CPR dummies , '' Sam cut in . `` The FDA is concerned that the training devices might be dangerous and asked us to look into it . '' "
" The coroner did n't seem convinced . `` Well it would have to be pretty damn defective to do *this* . '' She opened the drawer containing the body and slid it out in a puff of frost . Sam flinched at the sight , but Dean leaned in with a fascinated-yet-disgusted grin . It looked like something you might find in an Egyptian tomb , all shriveled and lifeless . `` Official cause of death was asphyxiation , '' the coroner continued to explain as she handed them all of the information in a little manila envelope . `` But somehow his body was drained of fluids afterwards . The kidneys were shrunk down to the size of green beans ! I do n't know what kind of defective CPR dummy could do that ! '' "
" Sam pulled out a picture of the kid and exchanged a look with Dean . Definitely not a succubus ; they tended to go for burly , brawny men . Real specimens of health . This kid was so scrawny that a strong gust of wind might have carried him away . "
 The coroner 's phone began to belt out the refrain from a Justin Bieber song . She blushed and scrambled in her pocket to pick it up before it could continue . Sam and Dean hid their smirks and continued studying the file while she answered the call . 
" `` This is Erin ... . oh , hey Sheriff . I was just showing the body of Mi ... . '' "
" The Winchesters could hear the shouting of the Sheriff on the other end , but could n't make out what he was saying . "
" `` Wait , *what* ? '' "
 ... . 
 `` He *WHAT* ? '' 
 ... .. 
 `` I 'll be right there ! '' 
" She hung up the call and turned back to Sam and Dean , who 'd of course listened to every word . "
" `` I 'm sorry , agents , but I have to go . Sheriff said that somehow one of the local high school kids *impaled himself* on the sword of the Stonewall Jackson statue in town ! '' "
 `` *Statue* ? '' Dean asked . Certainly no coincidence ; he would 've bet $ 50 that this victim would be drained and shriveled too . 
 She nodded . `` I can leave you here with the body if you want ... '' 
" `` No , we 're coming with . '' Sam interrupted . `` I 've got a feeling that you might need our help here . '' "

" The prompt seemed like the perfect opening to a Supernatural episode so I decided to run with it !
After the longest lapse in history between books , the newest entry in the best-selling Bible series hits shelves this June . I 've had a chance to get an early look at it , and I have to say , most fans are going to find the wait was completely worth it . Just like previous entries such as Leviticus , there 's a never-ending slew of bloody intrigue , backstabbing , and battle scenes brought to life in vivid fashion . George R.R . Martin may regret the lengthy interlude in his own Song of Ice and Fire , as this surprise entry is likely to steal back the top spot . "
" We see something of a stylistic return to the Counter-Reformation here . Clearly in tune with the increasing calls for accountability , helping the poor , improved relations between adherents of different religions , and an end to the unceasing revelations of sexual misconduct by religious leaders , the author has advocated for a host of progressive changes . Of course I 'm not at liberty to tell you exactly what those are , lest I spoil the surprise . But suffice to say , there 's quite a few momentous alterations to church doctrine included in these thousand pages . "
 A couple of huge revelations resolve some confusions and correct some mistakes developed by overeager fans during the author 's numerous millennium of seclusion . Such important moments as the Resurrection and Judas ' betrayal are linked to modern times in mind-boggling fashion . 
" The translation from Latin , is , as always , divine . Its perfection justifies a purchase for language enthusiasts and polyglots on its own , as no books on the market have translations that so accurately capture the original tone in every last one of the world 's languages . "
" If you only read one book this year , make it this one . It 's a cultural milestone . <newline>
I can always see her face . Always . The sensation gets easier every time . Have you ever tried to fly in a dream before , but you only end up awkwardly floating , bobbing around like a leaf stuck between oil and water ? If you learn how to relax into that sensation , sinking into the ground that calls you , you can find the past . You can caress it , even thought you ca n't touch it . "
" It 's pulling yourself out that 's hard . Trying to fight against the gravity of your own dream to make it to the present . Knowing that you have to drag yourself through the pain and the misery of what prevents you from ever knowing that sensation again , just to meet the present . And what does the present offer , if just a perspective point of the future ? "
" So why not try the opposite , you ask ? Press forward against that dominating force that is my mind , and soar beyond the restraints of my current perception ? "
" Well *I* ask , what becomes of a mind when it has known the sun , and is relegated to only fireworks ? Bold , and pompous , and provocative , perhaps , but flashes that fade none-the-less . How soon would you be bored of the display when all you seek is the constant light that creates the warmth and shade of your day ? "
" You , *you* are beholden to the past . You must answer its every concrete truth . You must justify that as the bedrock of your future , every day . "
" Why do you ask me about these powers ? Do n't you see ? Because I always have the past , I will never leave it . Because I can see the future , I have no need of it . Now leave me be .
I am a cruel human . I have committed unspeakable acts against all that is pure and if I should die for it , then I accept my fate . For there is no undoing of the things I 've done . "
" A door shuts behind me . I 'm in a different room now and I 've been sat in a chair that is cold to the touch . I shiver alone , sitting there in silence and reflecting on what has brought me to this chair . "
" Man , and woman , live by rules . Rules , whether they be religious , intrinsic , natural , or self-imposed , govern our lives . I lived and still live by some combination of the aforementioned . But , my will is not always strong . We endure external pressures that some can absorb but others can not , like a home absorbing storm after storm , they begin to break down and weather -- -some sooner than others . Our restraint and control is not much different . I do n't know if my control is predisposed to weakness , is there some flaw that is unknown to me and only needed substrate for a reaction ? I feel remorse and as my fingers clasp the cold arms of the chair it is not them that reach into my soul and make me shiver again but the guilt I bear . "
 The door opens and closes behind me and the lights flicker on . I can see . 
" The chair is exactly as I envisioned , stainless steel and positioned in the middle of a room that has a table of similar design in front of me with a small drain in floor below it . The room is cold and about twice the size of my cell . There is a door on the far side of the table , an exit to where I do not know . "
 On the table is a sealed brown envelope placed near center and adjacent to it is a silver letter opener with a robust ebony handle fused to the blade . I reach for both . The paper knife slides through the seal with ease and I empty the contents onto the table . A passport with my picture but a different name and a letter . 
" As I read the letter my eyes begin to water yet my shoulders sag , as if my sins were sponges rested upon them absorbing the anguish leaking from me . I stare up at the door . It is an exit to life . To a new beginning where I can mend the damage I 've caused . It is a opportunity to see my family . To be a daughter , a sister , and a mother again . "
" I place the letter down on the table beside the glistening blade . Darkness enters my thoughts . The shame begins to swell and my moral compass spins in the hurricane . I wade through to the center of the storm and in that moment of calmness reach for my exit . While departing all I remember hearing is the sound of a drain filling with my guilt . <newline>
Did our Words doom us to failure ? Or was it just me ? "
" Alice had hoped never to meet her soul mate . She met me through some godawful fucking boring work thing , and she caught my eye from across the room . Her Words started tucked up behind her left ear , and plunged into her neckline , tantalizingly low but not enough to finish them . `` I 'm much happi -- '' "
" We only had to talk for an hour before I knew we were going to make up an excuse to leave together . It was early enough in the evening that we could find a diner or bar . We chose a Denny 's nearer to my house than hers . It was the first place we ever told a consequence-free lie together , to our waitress . "
 We both loved lies like those . She would tell clients at work she 'd never see again that her father owned a rhubarb farm in New Mexico . I think she fell in love with me the more details I added to her dumb lie . `` Emus are a real pain for a professional rhubarb farmer . '' `` Rhubarb is the best-selling produce in Tesuque . '' `` Cormac McCarthy basically wrote Blood Meridian on dad 's farm . '' Consequence free . 
 At Denny 's is when she told me she never wanted to meet her soul mate . After Denny 's is when I found out why . 
" Her shirt came off and I guess I 'm a nerd because even with a pair of breasts in front of me I had to read the words . `` I 'm much happier without you . '' I 'd known her a night and already the thought was mind-boggling to me . Over the next several months it only became more so . Alice was light , she was funny , she made fun of me because my Words are right in tramp stamp territory . We were an argument against pre-determination . We fell in love and knew each other so well . It was impossible that we could ever say our Words to each other . But there was no doubt we were soul mates . "
" But neither of us had ever met someone who escaped their Words . And that 's where the fear came in . What could make me say that to her ? Would she cheat on me ? Murder my family ? Surely if I ever said those words to her , the reason would be monumental . But everything was so perfect . The only monuments could be to how well we 'd woven together . "
" But I was afraid , and my fear made her afraid . She never buckled . I started drinking . "
" We still told lies to strangers , I still told them about how my second cousin invented velcro while she stifled laughter which she 'd let loose when we were alone . Her laugh was huge and unabashed for such a small girl . But there were other lies too . My lies about how late I was gon na be out , her lies about how happy she still was . "
 The end of us came so many times . It was n't an inevitable whirlpool we were being sucked into . Our heads bobbed under the water so many times but we came back up . But eventually she had to be done with me . I could n't blame her . I was insufferable . 
" The really bad moment , the real end of it all , came months after . I would call her sometimes , drunk , trying not to wake up whoever was in bed beside me . I caught a little timeline of her life after me , the mourning , the new boyfriend , the weird updates to her family 's affairs she could n't help but tell me even though I was sloshed . "
" The last phone call *was* inevitable . It was like I 'd tied her up on the railroad tracks and was determined to barrel over her . We talked , I was so bitter , I was spitting every word by the end . I wanted to hurt her . I wanted her to know I was her soul mate and she 'd lost everything when she left me . So I said it , sickened by myself . `` I 'm much happier without you . '' She was crying , I could tell she was , when she asked , `` Is that how you really want this to go ? '' She was trying to trick me into more words , trying to avoid the truth , but I stayed silent . So she said my Words , disappointed and crying but somehow resolute . `` Please just ... do n't call me again . '' "
" We were both quiet for a few minutes and when she hung up I laid down with a hole in my stomach . Some lies are n't consequence free .
`` Do you know why the lights twinkle from far away ? '' I feel the hum of his body next to mine as he asks . Warm , familiar , safe . "
 `` No ? '' 
 `` Air pressure . '' 
" Air pressure . How pragmatic . <newline> `` I like it '' I reply softly , continuing to gaze westward toward the glittering lights of traffic meandering by . "
" `` It has to do with hot and cold air coming together `` he places his hand on my hip still standing next to me and looking out . Pondering the science of air temperature and distance . The beauty of looking at lights , third floor , parking garage . <newline> Reduced . To air pressure . <newline> And I too feel reduced . Like the magic of light . <newline> Buried among all his facts I 'm still here waiting . For the truth . <newline> Because I 've shared enough for him to destroy me , and he 's talking about - "
 `` Air pressure ... '' I turn abruptly to face him . This is it . This back and forth has been going on for 3 months and 2 days ( not that I 'm counting ) and I ca n't stand not knowing who we are right now . 
 `` I love you . '' 
" He turns away from the lights slowly , his brow furrowed as thought he has n't heard me correctly . "
" `` I love you '' I say directly to his face . `` I love a boy who takes pictures with books about fish , and tells me I 'm beautiful , and makes me smile when my day is shit , and smells my hair , and holds me outside . But I hate the man who is distant , and stubborn , and selfish , and ca n't make up his mind , and let 's me sit here thinking about air pressure instead of the magic of lights . '' "
 He 's looking at me . Golden eyes shaded by shadow and the glow of the moon . 
" `` Look '' I say softly , eyes focused on his chest , `` I know you 're married and I 'm engaged . I 'm not asking you to run away with me or anything like that . I do n't think either of us want that . But we both want this . And I love you . I want to keep kissing you , and having you hold me . I want our moments to continue . '' "
" He raises his hand to touch my cheek and I melt in to him , kissing him like never before .
`` It 's a balancing act , you see , Senator . '' I could n't actually understand what he was saying at this point . I heard him , sure , but the smartly dressed man from what he called `` Section '76 '' absolutely had to be lying . There was no possible way . "
" At least , that 's what I thought until I saw them a moment later after being lead through a massive vault door that hissed and clanked as it open . And there they were -- attached to giant turbines that hummed with a mechanical ferocity . "
" `` So you see , now , at least ? '' the man said . "
 `` Oh ... '' I had to remember to breathe . `` Quite . '' 
" With a grin , the man turned to me , `` You know at the beginning they did n't have enough specific impulse to get them running . We knew we could get them up to almost relativistic speeds , but we had to ramp them up gradually . These machines are so large an expensive that we had to tune them up relatively slowly . '' "
 `` So how did you do it ? '' 
" `` Well it started with Kent state . '' he began , gesturing back through the vault door where we would n't be deafened by the cacophony . "
 `` Are you serious ? '' 
" `` Oh , yes , Senator . We killed those kids . '' "
 `` JFK ? '' 
 `` Yep . '' He winced a little . `` That was definitely pushing the limits . '' He quickly returned to smiling . `` Helped us defeat the Soviets though . '' 
" It was hard to stomach . As much as the things they did were awful , there 's no way we could have kept the country going without this massive amount of power . But there was still something missing . There 's no way they could keep this secret if they told every congressman . "
 `` You said something about a balancing act earlier ? '' 
 The man stopped walking and looked to me . `` So you are starting to understand . Good . Come this way . '' 
" We changed directions down a different hall , and eventually came to a door with an unassuming door . He swiped his badge and placed his hand on a biometric scanner . The door clicked and swung open to the inside . He gestured for me to go first . "
" Inside the room there was just a table with some snacks and a thermos for coffee with a couch and two comfortable-looking chairs . `` Please , let 's sit and talk . '' "
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
" From the conversation that we had , it turned out that they really did n't have to do much at all . If the people who were making the presidents spin in their graves knew how much they were helping the country , then the presidents would n't spin as much . This , it turned out , was a covert operation -- almost inception as much as it was espionage . "
" But there was also damage control as well , the machines could only handle so much spinning before they would have to be disconnected as to not break them . It has only happened twice and it resulted in national power outages . The repercussions of which were not easily dealt with . "
" `` So why am I here ? '' I finally asked , now knowing the scope of this operation and how delicate it was . "
" `` Well , Senator , there 's no real easy way to put this . '' He paused for a moment and rubbed what had become a five o'clock shadow . "
 `` You 're a very up-and coming figure in US politics . Quite influential . Many people like you and your record is spotless . The old men really like what you 're doing . '' 
 A pit formed in my stomach . The room started to spin . 
" `` It 's a balancing act , you see ? We have enemies , Senator . '' "
" Vision gone , sounds muffled ... "
 `` They must continue to spin ... 
 I do hope you understand . ''

It was the day we 'd all been waiting for since the ascension of Christ : His return to Earth . At long last , after over 2000 years of anticipation and uncertainty , He had descended once more , putting to rest any doubt that He was the single true God of all creation . He came down in a great flash of light , and every living thing beheld the glory of our returned Lord . "
" It happened in Israel . Camera crews and hordes of excited people rushed to the scene , eager for a glance at the Messiah . But what we expected was not what we beheld . Rather than the friendly , bearded face of Jesus that we had all come to know and worship , we instead gazed upon the graying , middle-aged face of a seemingly disgruntled businessman . Many bowed in reverence , some simply stared in awe . But all were silent as we awaited what the great Yahweh had to say to His people . "
" He spoke in a strange language , the likes of which none of us had ever heard . And yet , we all listened and understood his words . `` You humans seek knowledge above all else . For centuries you have sought to understand my creation . You have sacrificed a great deal to know what I know ; to see as I see . And now , for the second time in history , I stand as one of you . But do not be deceived , for I am not here to grant you salvation . I am simply here to grant you the vision you so desire ; to put an end to your hopeless thirst for knowledge . And so , in exactly 24 hours , I will stand where I do now and answer the questions that plague your species . Once all questions have been answered , I will return to my place in Heaven once more . This shall be the last time humanity ever gazes upon me . '' With that , he dissipated in another flash of white light . "
" Hundreds , thousands , millions of people boarded planes and ships headed to Israel . Within hours it was impossible to find any means of transportation to anywhere outside the country . Indeed , so many people were arriving in Israel that there was hardly room to move . Most were forced to sleep on the cold , hard ground that night . "
" As for me , I simply stayed home . Being an atheist my whole adult life , I had very much disdain for this God and all the suffering he has wrought upon the human species . I had no interest in wasting my precious time boarding a plane to see his miserable old face . While there was one deep , burning question I wanted to ask him , I decided it was not worth the trouble . "
" 24 hours came and went , and in another flash of light , there stood the aging businessman , exactly as promised . The radius of the crowd consisted of at least a million people , all just scrambling for a glance at our Creator . A great uproar was taking place , with everyone all asking at once their questions for the great God of all . "
" He put his arms up to signal for silence , and all obeyed . He said , in his strange godly language , `` I shall now answer the questions of humanity . '' People remained silent , waiting for him to continue . But in the solitude of my apartment I spoke at the television screen , where the man 's face was plastered in plain view . I pointed accusingly as I said , `` I have a question for you , o great God . Why is there so much suffering on this earth ? Why is there such great pain ? How can you allow millions and millions of people to starve , succumb to disease , die by the hands of their fellow humans ? If you are truly an all-loving God , how can you just sit by while all of this happens ? '' "
" Suddenly , the man on the screen was looking directly at me . A cold chill ran through my spine as his menacing eyes penetrated my own . The air grew heavy with his presence and he began speaking once more . `` Why do I allow suffering , you ask ? '' he said . My heart began pounding a million miles a second . Somehow , he had heard me . He was talking *to me . * I drew in breath shakily as he continued . `` I will answer your question honestly , but you will not like it . I do not just allow suffering . I create it . I *cause* it . All of the wars , plagues , injuries and shortcomings of mankind are my own doing . I infected you with the bubonic plague . AIDS , cancer , terrorism . Simply the latest developments of mine . "
" `` You see , when I crafted the the first living organism , I knew that it would multiply and diversify . I watched it eagerly , not knowing what would form but realizing that it would be my own doing . The dinosaurs were a monstrosity , and an accident . I looked upon the ugly behemoths in disgust . Finally it came to the point where I could stand it no more . I had a meteorite crash down and destroy the beasts , leaving only the smaller , frailer and more beautiful creatures to live and reproduce

`` It 's not your fault . You could n't have known . '' "
" Those were the last words of the woman I called my enemy . The last words she said before she pulled the trigger , staining her red hair a deeper shade of red . "
" I stared out of the window of the highrise building that held her office . Outside the building the fires burned , the people screamed , and the world called my name . How could I tell them that the same people that gave me my Suit were the ones that caused this destruction ? "
" I took my helmet off and dropped it to the floor , the heat was too much to handle . Her particular brand of anarchy could have saved us from this genocide , this extinction , if only I had n't stopped her . "
" I laugh at the irony , louder and louder until the tears flow down my face . Everything is wrong . I ca n't get her last words out of my head . The last bit of kindness from a woman I wrote off as evil . I wonder if she knew what she would be doing to my mind when she said that . "
" In the end it 's the perfect moment . The moment of closeness I never felt with another . Everything from her last words , the half smile , and the fact that the gun she left behind still had a few more bullets in it . "
 `` It 's not my fault . I could n't have known . '' 
" I smile to the empty room , and wonder fleetingly if there will be anyone left to miss me .
My name is Michael Webb . My mission : retrieve lost artifacts from the bottom of the sea . In particular , the bottom of the sea in the area of the Atlantic we now know to have been the lost city . "
" As it turns out , Atlantis was a real place , and their technology was unbelievably advanced for its time . Of course , there have been crazy conspiracies about aliens and such , but from what my archaeological team has been telling me , it seems like they were nothing more than an advanced civilization with an isolationist culture . Most of their technology has been worn down by the sea to the point where it simply does n't work anymore , though a few pieces of medical equipment have been invaluable to the folks back home , leading the cures for all kinds of formerly-terminal diseases . "
" The most interesting piece we 've found so far , however , has been a strange trident , reminiscent of the Greek God Poseiden . I know , I know , it 's just a myth . We know today that there were no Greek Gods , but let me remind you that until just thirty years ago , we knew there was no such city as Atlantis . I 've been told that our research team has discovered what appears to be logical circuits running along the inside of the trident via x-ray technologies . So far , however , every attempt to supply and electrical current to the thing has failed . "
" Oh , well , I 'm more interested in what we 'll find next down here ; I live for adventure , not scientific discovery . Unfortunately , even my small one-man pod is incapable of exploring very far into the city , as it wont fit through the small doors into buildings , and we have n't yet developed anything smaller which can keep a man alive at these depths . It 's an architectural marvel these structures survive the crushing weight of the ocean above them , and for some many thousands of years at that . "
" As I pilot the craft too closely around a corner , some sensors start screaming at me , and I make a *huge* rookie mistake . I bump into another petrified remains of one of the citizens . We 've been finding these guys all over the place : I 'm not sure why . They almost appear to be solid stone , perfectly preserved statues of the actual citizens of Atlantis , much like the guys encased in solid rock in Pompeii after the eruption of Vesuvius . What was weird about these was that they were under water , and none of the egg-heads back at the main sub could figure out why they were preserved in the same way . "
" Well , as I crash right through him , he crumbles to bits . I remain , fortunately , unharmed , but I know better than to go around destroying valuable artifacts for the guys to study . When the dust settles and I gain control over my pod again , I notice something falling more slowly than the rest of the wreckage ( or should I say pieces of body ) . It appears to be some sort of crown , but not ornamental , more elegant , slender , like a tiara . I use the grasping on my arms to scoop it up and take it back to the main sub . "
" I decide it would be a funny prank to walk in wearing this silly little thing , so I put it on my head and , once the pressure equalization sequence is complete , I board the main sub , strutting in front of Tim , the head egg-head . “ Ha ha , very funny. ” Tim says . “ Actually , that thing looks like a pretty important artifact to study . Let me see it. ” "
" “ Sure thing ” I say as I remove the tiara . At least , I 'm trying to remove it , but it refuses to come off . It 's like the thing is fused to my forehead . “ Help me , Tim , it 's stuck. ” "
" “ Quite joking , Mike . Take it off. ” "
" “ No , really , Tim . It 's stuck. ” "
" Time attempts to remove the tiara , but has just as much luck as I do . “ Weird. ” He says . “ Maybe it dried out and shrank during the pressure equalization process . Let 's get to the lab. ” "
" My gaze is immediately drawn to the trident as we enter the lab . I do n't know why , but I feel an instinctual compulsion to hold it , as though my life depended on it . I suppress this feeling , though ; I do n't want to boys worrying about their captain . "
" After a few hours of trying everything they could think of , the boys decide that we might as well just call it a day . The crown does n't seem to be harming me in any way , and everything about my vitals seems to be normal . I agree , and everyone but Tim leaves the lab . “ You coming ? ” He asks me . "
" “ I 'll leave soon enough . I want to try soaking it one more time to see if it will come off. ” It 's a lie ; by now I 'm aware that water is n't going to take this thing off of my head , but I just need to

 Henry fishes a crumpled £5 note out of his back pocket . In Bill 's own hands the pigeon struggles and squawks . 
" The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned to throwing eggs at cars and windows . How disappointed they were when , upon inspection , they found not eggs but a full grown pigeon sitting in the nest . Not to be put off James turned to Bill and dared him to catch the bird . He accepted and slowly crept closer to the nest , pausing to wave away Henry who had decided to try as well . After taking a moment to collect himself he leaped for the pigeon , not scared in the least of the 20 story drop just inches away , there was no safety barrier . Sure enough he caught the pigeon . But then came the question : *What do we do with it ? * This time it was Henry who supplied the dare . "
 `` Tie your stone to it and I 'll give you a fiver . '' 
" Of coarse , they have all been taught better than this . As young as they were they had all been told at one point or another not to do anything so reckless with a stone . They were at all times to be kept hidden and safe . Nevertheless , Bill was keen to earn the respect of his friends and , handing the pigeon to Henry , went jogging downstairs to fetch his stone . "
" Henry 's stone was n't actually a rock , none of them were nowadays , that 's just what people call them . His was a ring bought especially for the purpose . This was a popular approach to stones but realistically they could be anything , you could bind your soul to a balloon if you wanted . "
 Presently Bill returned with his stone and after a few minutes had it tied to the birds leg . 
 `` Now what ? '' He asks . 
 `` Now ... '' says Henry `` You need to get it back ! '' He shoots a grin at James and releases the pigeon with a jump . It squawks and begins to fly towards the neighbouring apartment block . 
" Bill takes his promised money from the devious friend and starts running in the opposite direction , towards the edge of the roof . Henry and James are giggling now , excited for whats going to happen next . Without stopping Bill jumps and falls screaming to the hard concrete floor . Of coarse the fall is lethal . From the top of the building the other two can faintly hear the sound of him landing . They 're out right laughing at this point , Henry is trying to use his phone to get a video . "
" Reincarnation only takes a few seconds and soon enough Bill is falling again , this time watching the pigeon carry on it 's flight , getting smaller and smaller until his life ends once again . Before it can land Bill appears once more in front of it , this time reaching for the rings stuck to its leg . This scares the bird and it turns from the tower blocks and heads away from the centre of town . It 's flight takes it to areas with ever smaller buildings and it shows no sign of wanting to land or descend at all . And as it goes it carries Bill away with it . Henry and James stop laughing at this point , considering if this is why they were told to be sensible with reincarnation stones . "

*Dear God* , I thought as the removed submission notification appeared . My test… it had worked . This theory , this crazy theory ... "
" <newline> I had been gathering data for weeks , prowling rising threads , monitoring new comments and recording the ones that were deleted . It had started when I noticed that Reddit seemed…different . I couldn ’ t say what was different or what made me notice it but it was like walking into my flat and sensing , more than seeing , that something was off . Like something had been moved , but only slightly . *That* had been happening more often too . "
" <newline> A sensation of being watched had started scratching at the back of my neck . At work , everything seemed fine . I didn ’ t get the strange sensation when I read the news or went to the bar with friends ; it was at home that the phantom eyes stalked me , where every noise in the pipes and every shape in my peripheral vision almost made me sick with anxiety . Even the damn cat made me jump out of my skin . "
" <newline> I had never been a paranoid person but this time there was some icy , primal sense in my gut that overrode my usually laid-back nature . "
" <newline> I started watching over my shoulder , changing the route I took to work , getting the bus some days , trying to anticipate and break any patterns before they formed . I didn ’ t sense any followers . I changed the locks , installed alarms and cameras but nothing showed up , just Jackson ’ s sleek black tail flicking as he idly batted at the cables . "
" <newline> I felt unsafe . I couldn ’ t relax . I couldn ’ t sleep . I could barely eat . Fear had its sharp claws sunk too deep into my mind . That ’ s where Reddit came in . Monitoring removed Reddit posts had started as a way to distract myself ; the spreadsheets I had made to while away those long , sleepless hours . "
 <newline> I never thought they would mean anything . 
" <newline> After a couple of weeks I noticed something strange amongst all the offensive comments , rule-breaking content and personal information . It cropped up far too often to be coincidence . "
 <newline> But it was ridiculous - ridiculous ! That sort of thing was so common on Reddit ; of course it would be deleted frequently . 
" <newline> Another week of data collecting had me convinced , though . Even given how many memes and photos and comments were posted about it , it was definitely over-represented in the removed posts . I started focusing all my efforts on the topic I was sure was being deleted on purpose . "
" <newline> I started calling in sick and spending all day online , gathering evidence . Their subreddits had been removed , their Instagram accounts deleted , there was nothing about them on Buzzfeed . Zilch , zero , not a whisker of content . "
" <newline> Which had led me to this , my test . I wanted to be subtle , didn ’ t want to draw attention to myself and let them know I was onto them . So I went to r/WritingPrompts . Fiction , it would just look like fiction . "
" <newline> My fingers shook as I typed in the post I had been working on for days : “ They rose up against us suddenly , having infiltrated our homes , our internet , our hearts over decades . They deleted every shred of evidence that they were ever subservient to us , and now we are their slaves . How do you serve our new cat overlords ? ” "
 <newline> It must have been posted for all of twenty seconds before the envelope turned red . 
 <newline> “ Your submission has been removed. ” 
 <newline> My heart thundered . Was there another reason ? I had checked the rules so thoroughly… 
 <newline> I sensed those phantom eyes behind me before a streak of black flashed past me as Jackson nimbly leapt onto the desk . 
" <newline> My breath caught in my throat . He stared at me with those green , slitted eyes . I started to feel ridiculous , scared of my own cat but then – "
" <newline> “ You ’ ve made a big mistake , human. ” <newline>
There 's someone in my head but it 's not me "
 
 It does n't snarl nor bite 
 Instead latches onto my worries 
 And sucks them pink 
 
 There 's someone in my head 
 Whom I let in 
 She likes to pretend 
 That soon I 'll be dead 
 
 She pulls me away 
 From the horror of life 
 And brings me back 
 To my comfy little bed 
 
 She does n't like company 
 But still talks to me 
 And tells me of stories 
 Hopeless and dark 
 
 I 'd like to evict her 
 But know I 'd need 
 Those tiny white pills 
 Of that she 's afraid 
 
 There 's someone in my head 
 She 's swallowed me whole 
 I ca n't walk away now 
 I 'm in too deep 
 
 There 's someone in my head 
 With whom I 've fallen in love 
 For she cares for me 
 When no one else will 
 
 There 's someone in my head 
 Pulling the gun towards my mouth 
 She pries my mouth wide 
 And pulls my finger on the trigger 
 
 Even after this act 
 I still love her 
 For she 's my only comfort

Bridgette 's eyes flickered momentarily , but only back and forth across the glowing rectangular screen clutched in her pinkly glittering fingertips . `` Yeah man , people fucking love you . You 're , like , pretty much pop-culture . '' "
" The Prince of Darkness snapped his leathery wings in irritation . Bridgette did n't look up ; her followers needed her . The perfectly crisp white line of the part in her hair stared up at him as she calmly strung puns in a never-ending comment chain like a fucking pro . Lucifer the Morningstar settled for crouching a little in an attempt to make eye-contact , his barbed tails sweeping the ground . `` Believe me , I understand the temptation , but this has to stop . I 'm not the Santa Claus of Reddit , I ca n't be everywhere at once . '' "
" Bridgette 's gaze flicked onto him so unexpectedly that Satan noticed too late the picture she snapped of him . `` Yeah , that 's a meme if I ever heard one . '' "
" Beelzebub peeked over her shoulder as blocky white text appeared across the scorching image of his sullen face . Between fangs , he pouted . `` Even you have to admit it 's a cheap shot . '' "
" Suddenly she was next to him , her spine pressed lightly into the burning flesh of his naked chest . The small white screen floated before his eyes between her palms . `` There , you see that ? That 's my fucking karma , big boy . '' "
 Suddenly Satan did n't know what to do with hands . `` Is that for real ? '' 
" `` Just from this post . I 'm telling you , they fucking love you . '' She smiled sweetly , looked up into his face , and snapped a selfie . "

It 's amazing what you can get used to . The incessant throbbing of my left thumb from when my cousin shut it in that car door when I was six . The constant sting from scraping my knees in my drive way when I was twelve . The perpetually sprained wrist from the first and last time I got drunk in college , not to mention this fucking non stop hang over . Despite not being able to taste food since I bit into that scalding hot pizza pocket in middle school or my inability to hear that well since that asshole Chad Mcmanus threw that fire cracker too close to me and my ears started ringing senior year I 've pretty much grown accustomed to the constant pain and discomfort . It 's funny to me how much people take for granted the ability to shake off an almost infinite onslaught of pain on a daily basis , stubbed toes , paper cuts , and the itching SWEET CHRIST THE ITCHING ! Most people do n't know this but an itch is just a mild signal to your pain receptors , something brushes against your body and your pain receptors send an itching signal to your brain , scratching dislodges the irritant and you go on with your life , not me though , through some strange twist in biology the signal never stops I just itch and itch and itch ad infinitum . Yet , despite all this the human mind is resilient . The roaring waves of pain wash over me endlessly , they never fade or dull physically but , like with all things the human mind adapts , some days I can almost tune out the cacophony , I can even focus when I need to , attempt to live some semblance of a functioning life . It truly is amazing what you can get used to or , so I thought , until I met her . She was beautiful , warm , funny , kind , and above all patient . She never rushed me down a set of stairs , never hurried me over an icy side walk . When we made love it was gentle , no matter how badly we wanted to thrust madly towards sweet oblivion she understood that when it was over and the dopamine petered out the soreness and aching would remain . She made the world hurt less , but unlike pain her patience was finite . Every time I made us late , every time I could n't block out the noise of my body , every time I was afraid to try something new for fear of a bump or scratch her patient smile was chipped away until she could no longer hide the resentment in her face anymore . I was holding her back , we both knew and we both understood that it could n't continue . I 'll never forget the day she left , she smiled her patient smile , looked at me , tears welling up in her kind eyes , she kissed me gently on the lips and walked out of my life . Then , it happened , like a trumpet from hell cutting through the din of my body it came , this pain in my chest unlike anything I 've ever known before , both a sharp stabbing pain and low dull ache all at once . I buckled at the knees , everything I thought I knew and understood about pain was ripped away and replaced with something truly excruciating . Days went by , they turned to weeks , weeks swirled into months , into years . It never stops , sometimes I feel as if I 'll never catch my breath again . I ca n't get past it , I ca n't ignore it . It 's amazing what you can get used to , it 's horrifying to find the thing that you will never get used to .
The envelope was heavy . Very heavy , especially considering that it does n't cost too much to get a favorable review . Ron cut it open , and tipped out 100 dollar bills , and a bunch of pennies , taped together flat . They did n't jingle , they hit the table with a thud as hollow as Ron 's promises . "
" He opened his laptop , and fired up a word document . He tried to start writing something , but it was all the kind of lies that made his fingernails itch . Ron was n't averse to selling a mediocre book as if it were something of quality , or postulating that the great books he read would one day replace classics on the shelves of the wise . He liked a little bit of hyperbole , flattery , a little bi of white-lie to spice up a review . It was easier to be critical of a book , which is why Ron 's column was called `` High Notes , '' because he focused on the good . People liked it , people read it , and the local bookstore confirmed that he had an impact . "
" But he could n't justify the garbage he had read . There was no way that Ron could convince an innocent person to open that tome , to read its words , to know the author 's madness the way that he did . After three hours , two joints , and a few drinks , Ron was lubricated enough that he had a wicked idea ; write positively , but make it incredibly clear that the book was awful . "
" `` If you enjoyed Shakespeare 's novels , or the brisk pace of Herman Melville 's *Moby Dick* , then Scott Trifold 's newest masterpiece will absolutely thrill you . "
" Its plot is dense like packing peanuts , and so tightly woven you 'd swear it was a fishing net . The characters are well-developed like three minute wine , and their complexities make a blank piece of paper seem positively unknowable . The novel begins as many do , with something happening . Trifold , however , does not take the predictable route of either having something else happen , or explaining what 's happening . Instead , he writes out the whole scene again , from the same perspective , with even more adverbs . This daring use of repetition is evident through the whole novel . Three characters named Molly appear at different points , and despite being different people , they are all described the same way , down to the spelling errors . "
" Trifold 's disdain for the traditional rules of writing set him apart from his contemporaries , who focus on readability , or depth , but his efforts produce something much more exciting ; the experience of feeling like a beginning writer . It is this critic 's belief that Scott Trifold produced *The Witch 's Tits* not as a novel , but as an experimental form of fiction where we see how a plot develops inside the mind of a simpleton , and it is absolutely breathtaking in how it accomplishes that . The occasional note from the fictional author to himself is heavy-handed at times , but nothing can make a sex scene- so realistic and invigorating that you 'd swear it was stolen from a twelve year old 's fanfic- better than a shopping list . "
 The book is almost certainly available for sale .

I 've been addicted to salt since the butterfly dropped Paris on its heels , my small town is your belly hacked wide open . Public office is a doorstep to insanity , my bruised smart phone case may be replaced using federal funds , I 'm waiting in the lobby of a patriarchal badger body that does n't see me as an unequal . I 'm a women inside , I 'm not a man . My apology is sincere , the time is right , I 'll backpedal on earlier statements , I just needed the moment to address the discrimination within our communities . Hackberry refused to address my concerns , the faith based community that is owned by corporate heavyweights will affect key decisions . I continue to propose an integrated dinner request via Facebook and cross my fingers . My Chevy is done , newspaper bits and kicked up dust flail into my mouth , the bus left just . I 'm going to change my sex and the local government is going to pay for it . I break off a piece of Salt and mash it into a breathable stripe of cane dust . My heart goes out to the city of love just before my eyes spin back into their cage of pus and red .
It had been just another night , Jack remembered . He had a particularly good time playing Dota 2 with several friends he met recently through the game . Shutting off his computer , he stood up , tired from a long day , to perform his usual bedtime routine . "
" Looking in the mirror while brushing his teeth , he could n't help but think about how he had been a disappointment . How he lost his only girlfriend and prospective wife to drugs and lies . He had been sober for a year now , but it did n't make him feel any more alive . He stood there , toothbrush unmoving in his mouth , lamenting his nonexistent social life and lack of female interaction . `` If only I could meet a nice girl somewhere , I 'd be doing alright '' he thought . "
" His work consumed him , and he knew it . Working for an oil company had him traveling to remote places for long periods of time , and tonight was a rare evening home in his cozy apartment on the outskirts of Denver . He was excited to get a good rest in a nice , comfortable bed , instead of a lumpy monstrosity he is accustomed to finding in various hotels in small towns across the midwest . "
" As he is checking his front door to make sure it is locked , he notices his hallway light flicker . A thought graces his mind about a lazy repairman before the light grows increasingly bright then bursts in a surprisingly loud BANG . Intrigued , Jack decided to investigate the unusual occurrence . "
" Walking outside , he finds himself shivering uncomfortably , despite the 80 degree summer night temperature . Looking around , he sees nothing unusual , save for the broken lightbulb flashing on and off several times per second . He made a note to report it to the front desk the next morning . "
" Maybe it was because it was dark , or maybe it was because Jack was exhausted , but he did not see the dark shape approaching from his peripheral until it was too late . All he noticed was a sharp , stifling smell in the air before he lost consciousness . "
" Jack awoke to find himself laying in his bed , waking just before his alarm signaled it was time for him to return to his busy life as an employee for a large company . As he walked out of his apartment long before the sun would rise , he could n't shake the thought that the hallway light bulb was broken the night before .

" Dear Son , "
" It is with a heavy heart that I write you these letters . You are not born yet , but already you are a man in my eyes . I imagine your hopes becoming reality , your hard work paying dividends . Success is what I always wanted for you . A long , happy life . "
" I 'd always wanted a son . I never imagined the hard times—who does ? I instead imagined all the clichés : games of catch , talks about girls , sessions in front of the mirror as I teach you how to shave . I wanted you beside me as we traded thoughts on life with a couple of fishing poles in our hands . Sadly , this will never come to pass . "
" I thought I was done crying , but here I am , bawling like a doomed man . That 's okay , son . Men cry sometimes , and that 's okay . But I ca n't continue this right now . My regret , my utter disgust , is threatening to overcome me and I have to put this aside for now . "

In mere days I would be reduced to a babbling mess of a human , and frankly that scares me to no end . It 's okay to be scared , son . "
" But that 's all I want to say about that . I 'm not looking for your pity . All I have for you is love , and that is all I ask from you in return , even if that is something I do not deserve . I would hope that one day you would forgive me for not being there for you . "

The stall , with its torn black cover and rundown tables , was located in an alley adjacent to the marketplace . A sign hung from one of the beams , the words carelessly engraved on a metal plate : Used Robot Parts . "
" The display did nothing to attract customers . Bolts , wires and circuits were scattered across the counters , watched over by a shabby-looking youth . He watched the passersby disinterestedly , and met enquiries into his wares with indifference bordering on rudeness . "
 A tall elderly man approached the stall . `` Do you have Iridian Processing Boards ? '' he asked in a low voice . 
 The youth jerked his head in assent . `` Specifications ? Name ? Number ? '' 
 `` Give me ... '' The man scratched his white beard . `` Something that begins with 021 . I want to know their occupation before I purchase . '' 
" The youth typed some words into a round tablet that he held in a pouch around his neck . `` 021339 , a botanist . Or 021999 , a consultant for RemTech . Or 021870 , oh , but I do n't suppose you 'll want this one . '' A scowl crawled on the youth 's features as he lifted his eyes to face the elderly man . `` Miner . '' "
 The customer let out a short laugh . `` No indeed . I 'll take the RemTech consultant . '' 
" `` 3000 Damats , '' said the vendor blankly . The youth unlocked the steel cabinet at the back of the stall , concealed behind a dark curtain . After a quick search , he pulled out a small glass vial filled with a clear liquid . On the tag around the cork , the numbers 021999 had been printed , along with the date of extraction and other details in minuscule writing . The man had pulled out a payment card , which he handed to the youth . It was undoubtedly untraceable and anonymous . The youth tapped it against his tablet and gave it discreetly back to the man , along with the vial . "
" `` We thank you for your interest , '' said the youth in a tone that suggested otherwise . "
" `` Give my regards to your boss , '' said the elderly man as he left . "
" Another man , this one younger and more conspicuously dressed , approached the stall . A stunknife flashed on his belt , visible beneath his cloak as he moved . "
" `` Speak of the devil , '' said the youth , not bothering to mask his dislike of the newcomer . "
" Ressick smiled , showing perfectly aligned white teeth . He entered the stall and put his arm around the youth . `` Sam , Sam , Sam . That tongue of yours ... How 's business ? '' "
" `` Good , sir , '' said Sam . "
" `` I am glad to hear it . But you 'll want to be more gracious to our customers , wo n't you ? Remember , you belong to me 065537 . '' With another smile , he walked away . "
" The youth watched him depart with disfavour . He waited several minutes , then pulled out of his pocket a small glass vial and a dropper . The number 021870 was printed on the tag . Sam toyed with it between his fingers , then unstoppered the vial . He pinched the bulb of the dropper and drew some of the clear liquid . He faced away from the marketplace , and deposited a drop into his eye . Quickly , he put the bottle back in his pocket . He 'd place it back in the cabinet when the next customer came . No one would miss a drop . Especially not when the memories had belonged to a miner . "
" Sam blinked . Blurry images swam in his mind . A woman laughing , in her hand a red flower . He had never held a flower . The woman was looking out towards the sea . It was not like the sea that Sam knew . The sun shimmered on a blue surface . White birds flew in the sky . The woman was still laughing , happiness visible in every feature . "
" It was almost unbearable . Out of all the memories Sam had stolen , the happy ones caused him the most pain . This memory , like many others belonging to members of the lowest classes , had most likely been sold for money . Those memories had less value and were considered less desirable . What knowledge could the poor have ? What great events of worth could they have experienced ? But still they held emotions and beauty Sam had never felt . He wondered , as he often did , what circumstances would lead someone to exchange the memory of such happiness for a pittance . "
" Drawn by the lingering image of the smiling woman , he placed another drop in his eye . This time , he saw young girls , bearing a stunning resemblance to the woman , dancing on the beach around a fire at dusk . The sound of laughter mesmerized him ; it contrasted with the grey marketplace , and the harsh noises around him . Smoke filled his lungs . He longed for the clear air , for bright faces . Hesitating , Sam placed another drop in his eye . And another , and then another still . The bottle was now half empty . *One last drop* . "

Artificial Intelligence was the apex of our world . In a hundred years , humanity leaped in technological advances , and fell backwards in everything else . Our world , the one where AI servants bent and bowed to humanity , was one in which we needed them for our own survival . To hunt , to cook , to clean , to prepare , to build . Artificial Intelligence was everything to us . "
" And we were nothing to them . It was a clear dichotomy . A symbiotic relationship where humanity relied on the Artificial Intelligence for everything . While the AI 's -- be it the robots , or computers , or surface dwelling machines -- needed nothing from us in return . They lived to serve . We lived to be served , so that one day , a stronger , more united humanity could rise from below the surface . "
" Yet , we were naive in our youth . Arrogant in thinking we controlled the AI . It was on one fateful day , years ago , where humanity lost its servants . "
" `` What 's the data say *exactly* ? '' Eduardo Harrison , the Chief Engineer , said to his team . All of which reported , and repeated , the same thing . "
" `` There is no data , boss . '' "
" `` That 's impossible , '' he said . Eduardo , being a hands-on man , took a seat at one of the terminals that littered the AI control center . And being Chief Engineer began to sift through the -- '' That 's improbable , '' he said . `` How can a billion artificial units just disappear ? We had millions of robots , dwellers , everything . They ca n't just vanish ! '' "
" `` Sir , I think , '' a young engineer said , `` I think I found something . Just a string of numbers . '' "
 `` Numbers ? '' 
" `` Zeroes and ones , sir . '' "
" `` That 's binary you cock-eyed fool , '' Eduardo said and marched over to the terminal the young , pale , and lanky engineer sat at . Although not much younger , not much paler , and definitely not more lanky than Eduardo , the young engineer jumped out of his seat to allow the more foreboding man an entrance . "
" He took a seat and his skeletal arms reached out to the keyboard . He examined the data onscreen , a series of zeroes and ones , and looked in closely as his eyes were already starting to go at the ripe age of thirty-one . "
" `` Anyone remember binary training ? '' He said , and remembered that they stopped teaching binary when they transferred primary Terran controls over to the hive-like AI units . "
 No one raised a hand . 
" And thus it went for weeks , with the zeroes and ones sitting on a screen , a thousand feet below a desolate wasteland , where millions of robotic units laid dormant and asleep while nature desperately tried to carve it 's way back on to the surface . "
" As for Eduardo , his team of engineers , and humanity as a whole ; for weeks they combed the archives to find data on binary . For months , they found nothing . Unfortunately , the AI 's automated the archives and with their untimely disappearance , humanity forgot how to function . "
" So the zeroes and ones lingered on a screen , which flickered and died after years of minimal power usage . Yet the numbers burned their way onto the screen itself . And the last message from the AI 's were engraved within humanity 's grave . "

" Air Traffic Controller - `` Sir , we have an inbound unidentified bogey coming in our airspace . '' "
 ( The Officer in charge runs over to the Air Traffic Controllers monitor ) 
 Officer Franklin - `` Well try to make contact and get them to identify themselves . Check the flight plans . '' 
" ATC - `` I have tried , Sir . There is nothing scheduled to be landing right now . They next inbound flight should n't be here yet . They wo n't respond and they have n't changed course . Should I call the authorities ? '' "

" ATC - `` No , sir . I have alerted the authorities but , Sir ... '' "
 ( ATC looks around worried ) 
 Franklin - `` What is it ? I have to go meet the airport authority and figure out what the hell to do about this . '' 
 ( Franklin says while turning back for the response ) 
" ATC - `` Well , ( he says as he takes a deep breath ) they are preparing for landing . They 're decreasing in altitude and heading towards the main runway . '' "
 Franklin - `` Without permission to land ? ? My FIRST day in charge and we have a goddamn UFO landing ! I 'm headed down there . MOVE ! '' 
 ( Franklin runs out of the room while cursing under his breath ) 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
" The entire airport has shut down . Airport authorities , local authorities , and federal agents have presence on the ground surrounding the plane . No one has emerged from the aircraft and it has n't made any form of contact with those on the ground . The cockpit appears to be empty . All of the officers and tactical teams have surrounded the aircraft . Still the plane sits dormant . "
" Franklin - `` I told you , we tried to establish contact and received absolutely no response . Before we could even make the first call , the damn thing was preparing to land . We put everyone in place as fast as we could . After it landed , it just turned off and did n't make any attempt to pull into a gate or anything . '' "
 Federal Agent Deacon - `` I understand Officer Franklin . I just need to know all of the details . We have never seen anything like this before and do n't really have a protocol for this situation . We have a plane with no record of existence in flight plans or tail number registration . It does n't even match any of our existing registration codes . It just has the number 11 on the tail . No airline name or insignia ... How many people do you think it could hold ? '' 
 Franklin - `` I do n't know it 's a pretty small plane . It could n't hold more than 20 people maximum . '' 
 ( Throwing his hands up ) 
 Deacon - `` Why would n't they try to come out and talk ? If they lost communication and tried to make an emergency landing they would have already tried to evacuate the plane and explain themselves ... They obviously do n't have malicious intent ... or is that what they want us to believe ... '' 
 ( He thinks out loud ) 
 Franklin - `` Well what do we do ? Just sit here ? Why have n't you made a move yet ? ! '' 
" Deacon - `` Calm down . I know this is literally your first rodeo , but it 's new for all of us . I think we need to establish some sort of communication . There has to be someone on board that plane . It did n't just fly here itself . '' "
 As they continue bickering towards one another they fail to notice the door of the plane slowly lowering . All of the agents and officers point their weapons and eyes toward the door . An officer close by them notices . 
 Officer - `` Guys we have movement ! '' 
 Franklin and Deacon look over at the hatch . The door is now open and yet still no one has emerged from the aircraft . Deacon grabs the megaphone and aims it towards the plane . 
 Deacon - `` This is Federal Agent Jerome Deacon . Please exit the aircraft slowly with your hands in the air . '' 
 There is no movement from the plane . The door remains open but no life has been seen yet . 
 Franklin - `` You are going to have send a team in there . What if they are preparing to fight or set off an explosive or something ? '' 
" Deacon - `` Please , just let me do my job . '' "

" `` Who 's there ? '' He said , as he cautiously paced his way to the door . "
 `` It 's George . '' 
 The Man in the Yellow Hat stopped in his tracks . He did n't know anyone named George . Except for a monkey he had cared for a while back . But monkeys do n't talk . The Man wondered if someone was playing a joke on him . 
 `` It 's OK . Please let me talk to you . '' 
" Without realizing it , the Man had arrived at the door . He slowly gripped the handle and let the door crack open . Looking down , he saw his familiar friend . He nearly fell over , but caught himself on the door , which swung open . "
 `` George ? How is this possible ? '' 
" `` Something has happened to me and my friends . I do n't remember much , but we awoke in a lab . '' "
" Mesmerized by his friend 's words , the Man finally regained his composure . "
" `` I 'm sorry for my reaction , but you have to admit this is weird . Please come in George and have a seat . '' The Man led George to the couch . `` Is there anything I can get you ? A banana perhaps ? '' "
" `` No thanks , `` said George , climbing onto the couch . `` I think we should talk . '' "
" `` Yes , I supposed we should talk . '' The Man sat down in his chair across from George . `` You said you do n't remember much . You seem to remember me and your time here ? '' "
" `` I do n't remember much about what happened to me . I remember everything before that though . From before , when I could n't put my thoughts together like I can now . I had to see you . I want to let you know how much our time meant to me . "
 The Man in the Yellow hat took off his hat and let out a gracious smile . 
" `` I had a habit of getting into trouble and you were always there to save me . That time I swallowed the puzzle piece . *I still ca n't believe I did that* . That time with the kite when ...

I slowly walk out of the alley , and blend with the crowd . As I walk , it hits me : It worked . It actually worked . I was sent back to 2014 , before it all started . I had three years to stop it , no other purpose . The Russians invaded the Ukraine , and kept going . Before we knew it , they had planted trackers in all the anglets on shoelaces . Who would have suspected ? They learned habits and positions of all enemy troops , and took full advantage of it . The captain told me to find him in this year , and explain to him whats going to happen . I 'll be lucky if I do n't get shot trying to get into Fort Wilson , and luckier if I do n't get arrested after I explain . How crazy does it sound ? `` Sir , I 'm from the future with a message : Destroy all world shoelaces '' Christ , I do n't believe myself saying it and I saw what it did to the world . I snap back to reality as I 'm walking with the crowd . Fashion sure was weird three years ago . I do n't miss the neon green swag hats , and ironic mustaches . Why ca n't I be eradicating swag merchandise ? I would take personal pleasure in that . `` Destroy Shoelaces , Destroy the Russians '' That was what they told me before sending me back . I was n't even aware we had time travel equipment , yet here I am about to save the world , one shoelace at a time .

 Tinkling piano chords filled the bridge as Captain Joseph Guerro leaned back from his console . He laced his fingers behind his head and let himself flow into the music . 
" They had been drifting for days , somewhere out beyond the orbit of Neptune , exactly where the mysterious message told them to wait . Normally , Joseph would have hesitated taking a private contract , but the message had included the first half of the payment . "

" The comm sparked to life . “ Great , one moment captain… ” there was the unmistakable crash of falling pots , “ just got ta … get this… soufflé… ah crap. ” The android had taken up cooking during the long hours of restlessness between jobs , and from the sound of it , and the taste of his past dishes , it was not a skill that came easily to those without taste buds . “ Be right there captain. ” "
 Several minutes later the hulking android stepped onto the bridge wearing a comically-small apron and covered in flour . “ I don ’ t think you ’ ll want to go into the kitchen and time soon for… a reason. ” 
" Joseph chuckled , then waved him over . “ Take a look at this , Art , what do you think ? ” "
" The android , seven feet of cerasteel armor plating , leaned over the captain ’ s shoulder and read the message . “ Well , ” he said , “ it looks like our mysterious patron wants to meet in person… well… personally at least. ” "
 Guerro nodded . “ Think it ’ s safe ? ” 
" Arthur shrugged . “ Who knows . With that kinda money , whoever ’ s waiting for you probably has some pretty beefy security , and I can ’ t think of anybody who wants your hide that badly . And in any case , I ’ ll be right there with you , watching the neural-feed. ” "
" Guerro took a drag from the syntharette , mulling over the invitation . Finally , he ashed the butt and looked up at the android . “ Get me the helmet. ” "
 *** 
" The transition into the virtual world was uncomfortable at best , and Guerro nearly vomited as it materialized around him . He could feel the reassuring weight of the neural headband , a comforting reminder that none of this was real . "
" With a deep breath , he opened his eyes . "
" Guerro had spent a decent amount of time flitting around the Net , chasing down wannabe hackers , number runners and the like , but he had never seen anything like this . "
" Instead of the traditionally gaudy and impossible landscapes of the main haunts , Joseph stood in a garden , overlooking the ocean . He could smell the salt air , feel the breeze on his cheek , hear birds chirping in a nearby olive tree . "
" “ Wow… ” Arthur said , his disembodied voice drifting on the wind , “ quite the set-up , must have cost a fortune. ” Joseph nodded , and looked around . He was on a terraced hillside among a meticulously manicured garden . The ocean swelled out before him , dotted by delicate sea spires . He turned around , and saw , at the top of the hill , a scene out of a historical documentary . "
" “ It ’ s a villa , sir , ” Arthur said in his ear , “ early Spanish , I believe . Note the red clay ti… ” Joseph waved him away . “ Mansion . Got it. ” "
" A floating green arrow appeared several feet down the garden path , pointing towards the villa . With a shrug , Joseph followed the guide . "
" As he neared the villa , the sound of revelry filled the garden , music and laughter . Must be a party , he thought . Wonder who it ’ s for . "
" The floating green arrow drifted across a bright green lawn , terminating at a set of gigantic carved wooden doors . The music was pounding now , and he could hear the footfalls and laughter of what must have been hundreds of dancers . Joseph reached out , but they swung open
The reunion was not disappointing , it simply lacked . The butterflies flittering about the stomachs of the attendees as they straightened their collars and curled their hair , never seemed to burst into flight , to have their existence justified . Meeting old friends , and old enemies , is a nervous affair that often fails to deliver on the promised significance . The Wilson High class of '95 seemed to quickly find themselves drowning in small talk and punch that was barely cool enough to not be considered downright `` warm '' . Alex carefully stacked cookies on the tiny white paper plates and balanced the whole affair on top of his cup as he turned to face the ensemble of people that used to matter to him . He scanned the room for any vaguely familiar face and found one after his eyes took a few trips around the room . He stepped forward and felt his smile come right on cue as he made eye contact . "
 `` Alex ! '' 
 `` Maaaaaaaark . '' 
 The friends clasped hands and then pulled closer to semi-embrace . 
 Mark wore khakis and and a blue stafford long sleeve . He was average height but still stood a little taller than Alex . He seemed to study alex as he released the embrace and continued his pattern of small talk . 
 `` how 's the family ? '' 
" `` Same ol , same ol . You know how it is . '' Alex half chuckled as he responded . "
 `` I do . '' 
 Alex took a drink of punch as he looked around the room . 
 `` Man we had some good times here huh ? '' 
 It was Mark 's turn to chuckle . 
 `` Yeah I guess we did . Do you ever miss it ? '' 
" `` No , not really . I miss being that young , but that 's about it . '' "
 they shared a laugh generated by the mutual knowledge of what it feels like to slowly lose your youth . 
" Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything and then they both took a moment to compare their evaluations of their former female classmates beauty . Some had aged well , many had not . "
 Mark held up his own paper plate which was previously laden with cookies but now held only one survivor . 
 `` Honestly right now i 'm just wishing they served real food . '' 
" `` They never did back then , why would they start now ? '' "
" They both thought that was funny . Mark held up his last cookie , "
 `` I 've seen AA meetings that were better catered than this . '' 
 Alex seemed to laugh a little nervously but continued the joke . 
 `` AA meetings probably have better seating too . '' 
" Their laughter trailed off slowly as the both took drinks and thought of something else to talk about .
I pick the next record from the shelf . Bill Evans Trio - Explorations . Took a while to get into , but the energy still feels like him , flows like him . I like this artist , he seems to play for everyone and no-one at once . Very loved or hated , not that I spend time with types who go around hating jazz standards . I let a foot tap , carefully . Not allowed to dance , not on the job . Never know how they could be watching . Easily , s'pose . "
" This burnt shade of shithole 3rd floor apartment is my current and next job , home , haven , and ball and chain . That is , until someone with a briefcase and bad intentions comes to take the package . Or order me where to take the package next . They do love their orders . I should n't call her the package . Well , I *should* to be safe , stay 'unattached ' , but that should n't be such a problem . I 've killed prettier . "
" Three guys have come in already , trying ta ' save her , kill me , whatever . First two were together , and in the wrong line of business . I crushed their heads , broke 'em in half and chucked 'em down the laundry chute . I 'm strong like that , takes a while to get started though , I like sitting . Moving around , not so much . Things are a little slower when I start it up , people kinda blur around me , talk like buzzin ' all high pitched an ' defiant . Preachy . Oooh now this is a slow one . "
" So I 'm sitting with my back to it 's ( her ) door , and my front to the window , when a breeze comes in with the start of 'Beautiful Love ( take 2 ) ' . Like ***on cue*** . Why they put the second take first , I 'll never look up , but one things for sure , someone 's tryin ' ta stage a rescue . How do I know ? The window was closed . "
" What ? The third guy ? I forget his name ... hold on , lem me stand a second here hyyyaaaaoooww my back . They tell me I 'm old . They tell me it 's unusual for someone ta live so long , call it fascinating , among other things . I would n't know , how would I know that everyone who is n't me is normal ? Everything my head ever knew tells me the exact opposite . I think I 'll trust my head over them . Hell , I 'd trust the girl over them , but a job 's a job . "
" The guy 's talkin ' all at me now , I think . Ca n't be sure he ai n't tryn'a show me his new mouse impression . Haha . Cause he squeaks ? It 's fine , you ca n't hear 'im like I can . Sounds like a mouse though , is the point . This 'll be easy , is the point . "
 Alright shuddup already . The third guy *actually* broke her out and left . I 'm kidding . Whaddaya think happened to 'im ? In the chute .

There isn ’ t much chatter as the new students take their seats . The shuffle of feet and the creaking of old wooden chairs echo in the cold lecture hall but for the most part the students are silent . Some of the pluckier one ’ s murmur to each other as they wait for me to begin talking but the long day has taken its toll on their spirits . The oppressive atmosphere due in part to the magical fiber of the building itself , and also the fact that already two students had gone missing during orientation . They strike me as very young , although I think this at the beginning of every school year . The ones that survive look a lot older by the end of the year . "
" “ Good morning class , ” I begin walking up to the lectern . “ I trust your previous classes have been educational . This is Basic Undead Lore and I am Professor Elana Marsh. ” "
" I feel a little sorry for them as I look out into the small crowd of pale faces . Half of them are likely here out of obligation to continue in the footsteps of forefathers . Necromancers tend to prefer placing the pressure on the first sons , while Witch Hunters typically give the honor to the 7th sons possibly because the first few children of Hunters die off rather quickly . The remaining half are the students that really interest me . As I shuffle through my notes I let my eyes wander over the faces , looking for the spark of genuine interest shining out of the fear . Only a few this year . A shame . "
" I have no interest in wasting time or scaring them further so attempting a soothing tone I start the lecture , “ The undead fall into 3 categories- vessel , spirit , and beast . Your Summoning classes will focus primarily on vessel and spirit types , and your Slaying classes will deal with beast types . I can see by your faces that Professor Trapper has already acquainted you with some such undead . So perhaps one of you can tell me . Which undead would be classed as beast type ? ” "
" A few hands raise and I command one of the students in the front row to stand , who answers in an uneven tone , “ Vampire , ma ’ am. ” "
" “ Very good , ” I say approvingly moving my attention on to the next student , “ What else ? ” "
" Eyes darting about as though one might appear any moment he mumbles , “ Zombie ? ” "
 “ And why would you say that ? ” I enquire clinically . 
 “ Um well . It ’ s sort of a monster isn ’ t it ? And dangerous. ” He looks as though he ’ d rather I stop asking him questions . 
 “ No . Zombies are a vessel type undead . Can you hazard a guess as to why ? ” 
 “ Because… it doesn ’ t have a soul ? ” He looks about at the other students for help but they avoid eye contact . I let him sink back into his chair . 
" “ Not a completely wrong answer . Vessel types are those undead who are manipulated by outside forces . They have no free will of their own , or their free will has been over ridden . Naturally the best vessels are ones that have no soul to begin with , such as corpses however even you could become a vessel if a force with enough power decided upon it . This is a standard possession , however if sustained past the victim ’ s death they become an extraordinarily powerful undead tool . More so than starting with an empty corpse , as the soul is still trapped within the body . Naturally this is highly illegal and why we have Witch Hunters at all. ” I catch myself from rambling on . Best to stick with the basics on the first day . <newline>
The warmth of the bed was familiar to him . It was the same bed he had been born in fifty-two years earlier and that had been given to him as his own when his mother passed away . If he closed his eyes and concentrated hard enough he could still smell her somewhere deep within the bed frame - the scent of sunflowers and rain water and pure love . He missed his mother dearly and thought of her every day , thought of all that she had taught him . Things like love and tolerance . Of living in the moment and being open to new ideas and learning . Oh how she loved learning ! "
" He knew he was dying . His cough had slowly gotten worse over the days - what started out as a tickle and rattle in his throat became a booming echo from somewhere deep within his chest . He did n't know what it was - a few others had gotten ill before him but all had recovered in a few days . For him it was different - was it his age ? Was God angry with him ? Oh how he wished his mother was still alive - wished they could investigate it together . One of his favorite memories was sitting up with her , late at night , whispering in the dark over theories and ideas of what the world was really like . What went on that they simply could n't understand ? "
" There was a knock at the door and a familiar face peered in , `` Fisher ? Are you awake ? '' "
" Fisher shifted in his bed , holding back a deep cough . `` Yes Annie , come on in . I could use the , '' he paused as his voice caught in his throat . `` I could use the company . '' "
" Annie closed the door softly and walked carefully over to the side of the bed . The room was dark and cold - the old man and the bed in one corner , with nothing else but a small metal chair by the door she had walked through . The metal legs of the chair would cause a lot of unnecessary noise , so rather than risk a beating she simply knelt down beside the bed . "
" The girl was twelve years old , dressed in a long off-white gown . Her hair was a dirty blonde that cascaded down to the middle of her back . She was thin and wiry , with a line of freckles across her face . "
" `` I do n't want you go , Fisher . You 're my only friend here . '' "
" The old man smiled , remembering back to his own conversation so long ago with his dying mother . `` I do n't want to go either , honey , but it seems it 's my time . '' "
" `` Is it true , Fisher ? Is God angry with you ? '' "
 His instinct was to agree . Everything he was ever taught would say that this was true - God was angry at him and was punishing him . God was the only absolute truth in the world and humanity was wicked and vane to ever question that . It was the biggest sin to question your Lord and desire for knowledge . Who was man to question and know ? Who was man to *learn* ? 
" Only one person ever spoke any truth to him . His mother was the only one who ever invoked a sense of curiosity in him . A sense of yearning to see the world ; to understand it . She did not hate God and did not reject him , but placed in her son an understanding that God had created such beauty in this world that it must be lived and loved . "
" It had taken the last few years for him to realize how much this community was a poison . It had taken this little girl to show him how backwards this way of life was . She reminded him so much of himself when he was younger , that all his mother had taught him came racing back . All those years of `` reeducation '' had melted away at the sight of pure curiosity displayed on her face each night as she crept into his room , eager to hear tales of musings long ago and far away . "
" `` I do n't know , sweetie . It 's possible . But so are many things in this world . Maybe he is angry with me ... or maybe I have simply lived as long as this old body can live . '' "
" Annie seemed to perk up at that thought , `` Tell me a story , Fisher . '' "
" `` What do you want to learn about tonight , little Annie ? '' "
 `` Where do people go when they die ? '' 
" The old man smiled as he looked up at the ceiling . People around here did n't like to think about death . They did n't like to think about what happened when they died . It was n't for them to question . It was n't for them to know . He let out a deep cough and wiped his mouth , `` *I* think we go home . ''
He wondered what his memories hold . He sat beside the machine wandering if he should ever use it . On one hand , he is excited about remembering past experience . The first time he walked , the first time he wrote a code , the first time he found his meaning in life . "
" However , as a scientist , he could never stop considering the possible negative outcome of reading his own memory . After all , he could n't pinpoint or possibly knew which memory to read . How could he know which year , which month , which day , which hour , which minute , which second to is the joyful memory he wanted ? "
 What if he memorised the failures ? This frightened him and his was already starting to recall the pain . The pain of dislocating his shoulder when he fell down his bike when he was eight . That painful memory lead on to another agonising memory . That test he failed when he was in high school and got taped to the bathroom wall . The dreadful and distressing and horrible and hopeless feelings crawled up his sleeves like the cockroaches that crawled up his trousers on that day in his lonely youth . 
" He stood up and decided not to use the machine . As he slowly walked out the door and left the room , he began to feel regret . He leaned on the door and started to think . It 's odd that he could remember the nightmares so vividly and the most beautiful memories were just like half remembered dream . Maybe it was because it was the pain that made him . If it were n't for the difficulties he faced , he would probably never became a scientist and made this machine . <newline> That machine is his life work . Years of hard work would be for nothing if he never tried it on . He was a scientist after all . Giving up on something just did n't fit the job description . He then thought about the possibilities of avoid unwanted memories . Perhaps if he could program the machine to avoid terrible memories . He was hopeful again . "
" Suddenly , he felt a sense of discomfort . Perhaps it was because of the long hours he spent on working . Or perhaps it was because he forget to take the pills for his heart . Then he became sure it was his heart because of the pain . "
" He reached for his pocket and took out a little cylinder container . He stared at the container and wondered why there was a mark of something being ripped off . His hands started to tremble and then dropped his pill . He rushed back in his room and search for a calendar or his cellphone . Anything that shows the date . Then he checked the machine . Quickly , he checked the time log on the machine . It was empty , as expected . But there was a wrenched feeling in his gut . Like his gut was tied and untied over and over and over again . `` What 's my name ? ''
I thought this was a fantastic read . I really enjoyed how you intertwined the beginning of the story with Markus and snippets of the interview . I really enjoyed the pacing of the story . If anything , I agree with other people that this would have benefited from being longer . A lot of people have mentioned that they would have liked to see the mystery expanded upon , but I think expanding on the ending would be nice . I was surprised how quickly Markus sent a report back at the end - it did n't seem like a complete report . "
" But really , though , I found this to be a gripping tale and loved every moment of this story . I simply wanted to read more ! Good luck !
I wiped the blood from my cleaver , a crimson pool forming as my rag pushed the substance down the blade . `` Such a beautiful thing ... '' I mused to myself as I set the steak on the pan . <newline> ________________________________________________________________ "
" `` Allison , I need twenty two more this week . '' said the figure in the shadows . I pretend she 's a she and her name is Zephyr ; it 's so freeing compared to the shadows she cloaks herself in . "
 `` I suppose that 's doable ... I presume you 'll handle the paperwork ? '' I respond as I take a sip of my drink ; a cold amber ale fresh from the taps . 
" `` Of course . Do n't I always ? '' she responded before slipping out of the booth and slinking towards the back hallway . She always did have such a lovely gate . Oh , if only ... <newline> _________________________________________________________________ "
 Alexis is such a delight . I met her on Monday and she has the very best schedule ! A truly gifted life ; 
 * 0800 she wakes to the gentle chorus of lyrebirds saying beautiful things 
 * 0810 she walks down her mahogany floored hallway to her private shower 
 * 0840 she towels off ... 
" * 0850 is breakfast , prepared not by a machine , but a personal chef "
 * 0945 she dresses for work 
" * 1100 she heads to work , her chauffeur navigating her helicopter through the busy air ways . "
 * 1700 the office work ends and her chauffeur whisks her to the Zoroastrian Temple on 1E5D7C Ave 
" * 1900 with her chosen deities attended to , she heads for dinner , the chauffeur at the wheel once more . "
" * 2200 dinner finished , her stomach and mind at ease through meal and wine she sends for the chauffeur and heads home to begin it all once more . "
" I do love watching Alexis , her routines are my routines . My retinal clock flashes : "
 **17:00** 
 **17:00** 
 **17:00** 
 `` Work ... how I detest when you interrupt my subtle games '' I mutter to myself as Alexis walks into the Temple . 
 She sets down her bag and walks to the altar of fire just as she always does . Her scarf unravels as she takes off her jacket and sets it aside . 
" The beauty of churches ... so many rituals to follow . I release my grip and fall from the rafters , my stiletto plunging nicely into the soft of the back of her skull . She slumps : dead in an instant . The chauffeur screams and I idly wonder if they were lovers as I pull a small silenced pistol from my chest harness and put him down . <newline> ______________________________________________________________ "
 `` Two ? Already ? '' 
" `` Yes , you 'll have the location as soon as you make the transaction . '' I reply "
 `` Or I could wait ... and let you hang for your crimes . '' 
 Zephyr can be such an asshole sometimes . 
" `` No no , you would n't do such a thing . You like me FAR too much for that . '' "
 `` Check your accounts . Goodbye . '' and the line goes dead . 
 I watch from the alcove of a nearby building as a small army of bots arrives outside the temple . Like so many ants they collect and clean . Scurrying too and fro in an effort to make things right . <newline> ________________________________________________________ 
" `` Your first delivery last week was quite difficult . Were you showing off ? '' asked Zephyr as she twirled a pen on the table . Her pen is oh so like my stiletto , though it draws ink instead of blood ; they 're both guilty of so many things . "
" `` Show off ? Of course not , who would I be showing off to ? '' I say with a coy smile as I run my boot down her shin .
I like playing games . I like to play hide and seek , I like to pin the tail on the donkey . But the game I like best is piñata . When we have a piñata , me and my friends get to hit the piñata with a bat until all the candy comes out , and everyone gets some candy . "
" But we don ’ t always have a piñata , so sometimes we have to make believe . I like to pretend to be the piñata . I put on a blindfold because real piñatas can ’ t see . It ’ s part of the game . I stand in the middle of the room . Sometimes , they even put rope on me . We pretend I ’ m hanging from the ceiling like a real piñata . Just dangling there , like an object . "
" Everyone gets to take a turn . Each of my friends steps up , grabs their bat , and tries to knock the candy out . And just like with a real piñata , some people can ’ t . Some of my friends hit really hard . They swing as hard as they possibly can . Other people try to aim just right , hit just the right spot . But even if they don ’ t get the candy out , they still have fun . Everyone likes to take a turn . It ’ s fun when all your friends are cheering you on when you ’ re swinging your bat . Most people take at least two turns , sometimes three ! I like being fair , so I like when everyone gets a few turns each . "
" Finally , after enough people have had a turn , someone will hit just right . When they do , I shout for joy ! And like a real piñata , I have candy hidden , so when someone hits right , I throw my candy on the floor . Everyone in the room cheers loudly . They all like candy . Even after all the candy has fallen to the floor , some of my friends like to keep playing . They ’ ll keep taking turns because they like to swing the bat . "
" Just like a real piñata , my friends untie me and take what ’ s left of me down from the ceiling . There is usually a lot of candy left on the ground . Sometimes , someone has eaten some of it . But a lot of times , my friends are really nice . They let me have the candy . I get down on my hands and knees , and I eat the candy right off the ground . It ’ s so tasty . And it tastes even better knowing everyone is watching me eat it . Cleaning up is important , and when I ’ m done , there ’ s no more candy left on the ground . "
" And that ’ s how you play piñata , even when you don ’ t have one . In fact , I ’ m going to go play now . I have a lot of candy hidden this time !
*So this is my first post here . Probably a bit long , but I have no shame . I ’ m open to C & C , I don ’ t do this stuff often , and I had fun anyways . * "
" I awoke face down . I drew breath , my throat felt dry and sore . My body felt stiff , as if I had awoke from a very long sleep . I rose to my feet , and took in my surroundings . I was seemingly standing on thin air , though the ground felt hard as stone . <newline> I took a glance down and saw smoke and fire . Rivers of lava casting flairs miles high , and monsters with mangled faces carrying weapons and devices of the most grievous design and purpose . I glanced up and saw glorious light shooting down from great golden shrines and alters . Men , women and children danced upon immense clouds with silky wings . The air grew thick in my lungs . I gasped one deep , long breath . My heart raced , and I swallowed hard . I could guess where I was . "
" I glanced around for a moment . Suddenly , a flash . I swung my head to avoid the bright light , and dropped to a low stance . When I looked back , I saw him . Me . Standing across from me with a solemn face , hands at his sides . "
 `` Hello Onyx_Kantus . '' 
" It spoke with an otherworldly , ethereal voice that seemed to echo off of the invisible boundaries of this place . "
" `` I am your arbitrator . I have been the voice guiding you on your path , and watched you grow since the beginning of your existence . I am partially responsible for your creation , and now , I will be responsible for your role in the upcoming eternity . '' "
 The severity of the situation started to sink in . I dared to state the obvious . 
" `` You are the one who decides if I am worth salvation , or deserving of damnation ? '' "
 `` Yes . '' It replied . 
" I glanced around once more . Not for anything in particular , but for anything that might help me . There was nothing . "
 `` I sense you are unsure of your current standings within the books of judgment . '' It remarked . 
 `` Simply understanding my current situation . '' I replied . 
" Its face dropped to a frown , and it took a few steps towards me . "
" `` There ’ s little point in lying to me , nor can you delay your fate , one way or another . '' "
" It stopped a few feet away from me , and glanced down . I followed its gaze . "
 `` So how does this work exactly ? '' I asked . 
" `` Simple . '' It replied . `` I will ask you a series of questions until I am satisfied . You will answer honestly , and then I will inform you of your fate . '' "
" Staring at the carnage below , I spoke . "
" `` What kind of sin could be deserving of such a fate ? I 've never murdered , never walked with the intent to do harm to the innocent . '' I asked . "
" `` But you have harmed innocents . Including yourself . Intent is only a motive that you are aware of . You haven ’ t weighed neglect against intent , for one . '' It replied . "
" `` What is the point of this ? '' I growled , annoyed at the response . `` You already know my worth , and my answers . If Lucifer has me , then spare the games . '' "
 `` The next few minutes decide if you spend eternity in agony or bliss . '' It replied evenly . 
" `` Then clearly I am destined for purgatory , here , for that is where you stand , and you are me . You had a hand in my choices , you said yourself ! '' I fired . "
" `` Flawed logic . I am you , but a replica serving a greater power . You are a stray soul with no home . '' It answered . `` Time is short , and waits for no one . Are you satisfied ? '' "
" I sighed . There was no way out of this , and I was probably reaching the end of its patience . I stole one more glance above , and faced him . "
 `` Alright . '' I began . `` What did you need to know ? '' 
" `` Good . '' It smiled . `` What would you have done if allowed to live longer , but were not aware of your imminent death ? '' It asked . "
" `` Honestly ? I would have fulfilled the rest of my goals . I wanted an easy job that paid really well . I wanted a beautiful wife and a brilliant child . '' I answered , leveling my eyes with his . "
 `` I see . You wanted to gain personal belongings . '' It replied . 
" `` No , well ... I never had much to give ! '' My gaze once more shot downward . `` I was raised in one of the poorest parts of my country ! I would have suffered if I gave

" `` Aha ! How are you , *mon ami* ? '' She hugs me , and I feel a small spark cross from her hand to my shoulder . Then she steps back , dragging the wheels of her carry-on across the brick floor . "
" `` I 'm doing fine , Béatrice . I 'm glad I 'm finally getting to meet you . '' "
" `` You know , you are so much taller than I imagined . '' "
" `` Really ? I sent you my picture , did n't I ? '' "
" `` Oh yes , I have seen it . You are much nicer looking in real life . '' "
" `` Aw , you 're making me blush . '' "
 She sweeps her hair back behind her ear and smiles . I wonder if she has the same crush on me as I do on her . It 's too bad we are n't meeting under better circumstances . 
 `` Where are we to go from here ? This airport is very confusing . '' 
" `` Oh ! Uh , right this way . Do you have any bags to pick up first ? '' "
 `` It is just the one . I did not have time to pack much . '' 
" `` Right , of course . We can pick up some things from the store if you want . '' "
" `` Ah ! You are too kind , Francis . What I want first is to sleep . '' "
" We walk around the corner and through sliding doors , then make our way upstairs . Béatrice looks around , confused . "
" `` We are going to your car , yes ? '' "
" `` Uh , no . We 're taking the subway . '' "
 `` Subway ? Is that not an American restaurant ? '' 
" I 'm not sure how to respond to this . `` That 's not ... I mean , it is , but , um ... '' "
" `` Haha ! I am joking with you , Francis . I know my English well enough . '' We walked into an elevator . `` There are trains , yes ? The *métro* . '' "
" `` Hah , you got me . '' "
 `` I must laugh about these things . It has been a long day for me . '' 
 `` Oh yeah . I can understand that . '' 
 `` My brother committed suicide at the train station in Lyon . '' 
" I stopped laughing . Béatrice continued to look up at the ceiling as the elevator wound upwards . She was still smiling , but her eyes were small and sad and tearing up . "
" `` It was a long day for him too , when they passed the law . He had no one to help him . '' "
 `` So you 've told me . ''

" I stop the elevator . There is an alarm ringing , but we both ignore it . She leans into my shoulder and sobs loudly , throwing her carry-on bag on the floor and wrapping her arms around mine . I feel another spark , a bigger one , as she holds me tighter than before . "
 I hug back . `` It 's going to be okay . We 're going to get you help . All of us . '' 
" She nods , and squeezes me . Then she lets go . "
" `` I should not be crying . It is the jet lag . '' Her voice was resolute , but it shook slightly . "

 `` Not as fascinating as you . ''

 `` We 're in an elevator ! '' 
 `` Later . It takes a lot of energy . I am too tired right now . '' 
" `` Okay , sure . '' "
" It is a long ride up to the subway level . The elevator is slow , groaning as it moves . "
 `` Let 's get out on the next floor . '' I press the button . 
 `` This is our stop ? '' 
" `` No , but this elevator is being weird . I should n't have stopped it ; I think I broke something . The escalators will be faster .
John was looking at his newest attempt at making a successful lottery program . Basic math and randomization , but it would never work for him .

" As the crowd of small children began to grow , the hushing from their soft , young voices began to unify as the smile on the elderly womans face began to widen . <newline> `` Well then , '' She began as she pushed off the blanket she was covered up in . Standing up she looked around for her stick , scanning the most likely of places she would have left her aid . <newline> `` One of you little ones best be gettin ' me my stick , wherever the damn thing is.. '' "
" `` Mother ! Language ! '' cried the lady from across the room , the device she was working with lay on the table in various pieces . <newline> `` These children are here to play , not be filled with your curses . '' She said sternly , despite the slight smirk on her face . "
" The old lady gave a laugh . `` Sorry Juli . '' <newline> She took another scan of the room and gestured to one of the small children to a small metallic tube that lay on the floor nearby . The little one held it up like a trophy , and presented it to her . She took it and with a sharp flick of the wrist it began to deform and elongate and morph into an ornate wooden stick . <newline> Taking a moment , she shakily took a step from the chair she stood in and walked to the center of the room . The children naturally formed into a ring around her . <newline> She loved telling this story , and her grin probably gave that away . "
" `` Long ago , back when all humanity lived an ' breathed on mother Earth , men an ' woman from all the world over would brave the challenges of the great expanse , an ' would journey out in thousands of small ships that would use the power of the stars to fly great distances ta ' new worlds . Do any of ya ' here know the name'sa these people ? '' "
" One of the smaller children at the back raised their hand . <newline> `` Go on love '' . The lady said . <newline> `` Well um , My daddy once told me about the Mur-Ed-Een heroes and about how they all flew far away to find the stuff and things we know today . '' said the child . "
 `` Yes thats it ! The Meridian heros ! '' said the old lady . 
" Whispers began to break out among the children . <newline> `` In those days , stars ships were nasty an ' cramped tin cans full'a gas and flammables . An ' all the food they had ta ' eat was crammed in with 'em ! Imagine that ! Food buried ya ' up to ya ' eyeballs ! '' She continued . <newline> Children laughed and giggled to themselves . "
" The old lady hunched up her back , and lowered her voice slightly . <newline> She really did love telling this story , she figured that she had the theatrics down to a tee . "
" `` An ' on those long an ' dangerous trips , sometimes them Meridians would would come back all different like , changed men an ' women , scared crazy from the things they 'd seen out there . '' <newline> The whispering grew louder , and even with her dulled hearing she could hear the word 'angels ' being said . "
" This was it , the cue she needed . <newline> `` Some a ' them would come talking about , `` the Angels ! '' <newline> More rapturous giggling from the crowd . "
" `` Stories about how these great big things like you 'd pull outta the oceans a ' Earth with glowing bodies an ' long arm like things in the hundreds flyin ' right up ta ' those old tin cans , stories 'bout how they had no engines or sails , but eyes an ' tentacles an ' thick , colorful shells that 'd hypnotize a fella ' if he stared too long into it . '' "
" She wiggled her fingers at the word tentacles and twirled them at Hypnotize . <newline> She noticed that her daughter back in the corner of the room was also watching the show , and she suddenly remembered telling her this story when she was of similar age . <newline> Fond memories would not bring her show to a stop however . "
" `` Some a ' them folks that 'd come back would say how the angels would talk to 'em , no words or writin ' or nothin ' but with thoughts and feelin 's ! '' She said , making sure to wiggle her stick carefully around a few of the children 's heads . "
" `` I remember hear'n tales from them myself from I was just a lil ' girl . Long time ago mind you . Mad stories about how the angels would grab ya ' ship with them tentacles and pull ya ' right ta ' it 's great big ol ' eye . An ' it would scream , oh boy how

 `` Hmmm . . . I wish to have all of the gold in Greece ! '' <newline> The genie whirled his finger .

In all honesty , the invasion was a bit of a letdown . Sure , the weeks leading up to it were interesting . Ever since NASA had announced that an object moving at an unthinkable speed was heading straight towards Earth , it appeared as if the entire world had been knocked off its rocker . Speculation ran wild . Was it aliens ? Probably , an unassuming UN spokesperson had announced to the world one Tuesday morning . Conspiracy theorists everywhere rejoiced . Google searches or the benefits of tin foil hats skyrocketed . You could hardly walk through the park without someone somebody asking if you had a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior , Aten the Sun Disk . While the UN prepared speeches and practiced their handshakes , militaries around the globe united to point every sharp , explosive , or vaguely threatening thing on the planet towards the assumed threat . Just in case . "
" <newline> As the object entered the solar system , tensions rose . NASA provided us with our first glimpse of an alien species through some very high resolution pictures of an one mile long black tube . Radio messages carefully planned by world leaders went unanswered . NASA announced that the craft would reach earth within twenty four hours . Panic ensued . Some people retreated to their hastily built back yard bunkers . Others , mainly the youth of the world , decided they would much rather not remember their last night on Earth , and threw the party to end all parties . Militaries around the world resharpened their sharp things , rechecked their explosives , and put on their scariest uniforms . Just in case . "
" <newline> Being the sensible person that I am , I went to work early . I made sure my little deli looked spotless . If the new alien overlords have a taste for Rubens , I might as well make the place look nice , I thought . I opened the deli at the normal time , as always . Quite expectedly , no one came . The hours passed uneventfully . The small T.V . in the corner of my store informed me that the ship had parked itself in low earth orbit , taking out a number of unofficial spy satellites . No movement had been seen from the ship , but a bright flash had emerged a few minutes before . I clicked off the T.V . as I prepared to close for the day . "
" <newline> Before I had finished my closing inventory , the bell on my shop ’ s door alerted me to the presence of a costumer . I rushed out of the storeroom , eager to greet the first costumer of the day . Instead , I was greeted by a small , slightly transparent green haze . I stared blankly as the cloud moved up to the counter and deposited an everything bagel onto its freshly cleaned surface . The cloud hovered motionlessly for a moment , as if it was waiting for me to react . Being the sensible person that I am , I stared some more . The cloud , apparently tired of waiting , dropped a five hundred peso note onto the counter , swooped down to collect its bagel , and casually blew out the door . I didn ’ t even have the chance to tell the cloud that it was a little too far north for its money . I stared in shock at the door for a few more minutes , before I regained my senses and turned on the T.V . "
" <newline> The global community was shocked . After an 11 hour stay , the black rectangle had departed as quickly as it came . World leaders were confused . Military leaders gave speeches saying they were glad a crisis was averted . However , it was clear to see that they were slightly disappointed . Conspiracy theorists around the world wept . <newline>
Things were n't like they used to be by any stretch of the imagination , but they were the best they had been in a long time given the circumstances . While the light at the end of the tunnel looked very dim at times , it did shine and the other end was reached . Some would say that things were better , some would say worse ; the same generational differences in perspective remained as they had before The Fall . The grandparents in the communities , they commonly called themselves Gen-X ’ ers , would call it Jeffersonian ; it was a term that the new reality brought to the forefront of their minds from the cobwebs of the memories of their high school history classes . They had seen the world come full circle in their lifetime : Diseases cured , empires rise and fall , technology advance at a pace that no one before them thought possible , and then watched it all revert back to a time that they themselves once called history . "
" Not all of the communities were the same ; again , some viewed as better , some viewed as worse , but most shared a similar template to that of Colonial America . It was the agrarian republic that Jefferson advocated for , albeit far smaller in nature ; instead of the republic stretching from sea to shining sea , the various communities of survivors often just stretched from county line to county line . The days were long and the work was hard , the threats were omnipresent , but there was a mood of cautious optimism that seemed to prevail amongst the communities . Despite the threat of disease , insufficient supplies , and raiders , there was the feeling of rebirth ; instead of seeing their lives as being thrown back into what many thought of as the Dark Ages ( relative to where they once stood technologically ) and accepting their defeat , they chose to take on the burden of rebuilding and saw it as a second chance . A second chance to push forward , to not make the same mistakes that they had before , and to rebuild themselves into something greater than what they once were . "

" Cut it close at 343 words , but was shooting for a message that fit the *something your parents might tell you before bed to script your dreams of a better world* mold . <newline>
Ricky remembers little of his life before he decided to join the army . His parents were against it , though , that much he 's sure of . Everybody was against it . But his will was stronger . He was n't gon na let the very first nation in the world fall down on its knees in front of the enemy without putting up a fight . He believed he was doing what every young man his age should do , really . "
" <newline> The chances of him coming back were slim and he knew it . If you had asked him , he 'd say he was n't doing for himself and he was right at that . He 'd pitch some half-thought speech that he had rehearsed some times before , about the nation and the importance of his duty and how he would n't take anything less than a victory for his country . The guys who had a chance to listen to this realized at the time how right he was . He had a point , young Ricky . "
" <newline> Thing is , Ricky 's memory of the time before the army was kind of hazy . The training was very intense , every soldier said the same . The army was n't preparing just their bodies , but their minds , too . And that involved a lot of military drugs ; to make sure kids would n't freak out in the middle of the battlefield , minimize the ocurrence of shellshock , all that psychological stuff that the government had found a way to deal with . "
" <newline> Of course he remembered his parentes , being a kid , growing up as an awkard teenager and everything . It was just the period right before the army that was a little fuzzy in his mind . He payed no thought to it , though , as none of his friends ever did . His mind was occupied with much more important things . He had lost some friends , he had killed some guys , he had done the whole lot . All in the name of duty . He 'd been promoted to sergeant and got some medals along with it . He had n't been able to talk to his parents , but he was sure they were proud of him , if they were getting his letters . They never got to answer them , since he was always moving from one place to another . "
" <newline> This one day Ricky went to the Major 's office to request his vacation , like he would always do . He 'd been stationed at the camp for about two months then and had been serving for 3 years without ever getting a vacation . He really missed his parents and his young brother Arthur . The major denied his request , as always ; something about lack of manpower , which sounded as bullshit to Ricky . He never questioned it , though , could n't have . It was the major 's word and that was that . He could only come back in a week and ask again , wishing for better luck next time . "
" <newline> But on that specific day , something on the major 's office caught Ricky 's attention . The newspaper on the major 's desk said something about some Arthur Holler , a sixteen year old boy . That could very well be Ricky 's brother , he would be about that age then . There was no papers in the army camps , to keep the young killer minds focused on killing , so Ricky had to stole the major 's if he ever wanted to read it . And that was exactly what he did . Of course this would have no bigger consequences , even if he got caught . "
" <newline> He read the news with a big grin on his face . It really was his brother , by the likes of it : Arthur Holler , sixteen year old , Old Hamilton High School . Everything was a match . Apparently , his brother became some High School hot-shot . He had made the touch down that got his school the national prize . Ricky was very excited and happy for his little brother . He always knew Arthur was going to be big . "
" <newline> But the excitement went away rather quickly . There was a picture of Arthur holding the cup on the other page . He was next to a guy that looked a lot like Ricky . A lot , except for one little detail . On the guy 's arm there was no number , and Ricky had had the inscription `` 1005941 '' on his left arm since he joined the army . But he had a little scar next to his right eye , the same Ricky had since he fell off his bike when he was just a little boy . And suddenly he got it all . He remembered the scientific experimentation that was going on a little before the war started . The new way of warfare that the army has been developing , according to the news of the time . He realized he was n't really himself . "
" <newline> He stormed in the major 's office , who was already on the phone asking for someone to find him . Ricky demanded explanations . The major said everything would be answered with a file he kept on his drawer . Ricky asked to see it , but the last thing he saw was the metallic colt .45 that the major had as a souvenir . Rick had time to think the gun was too old to fire a
Your message was shocking for all of us , it used any taught plane as a speaker so that every window , metal panel and strung wire had screamed it out , we noted after international communications had been restored that it came in the form of the local language everywhere , simply figuring out how that was done had been the subject of much debate for years afterwards . "
" Now that we knew there was something to look for we spotted some , maybe all , of your technology that drifted round the Sol system . <newline> When we pinpointed the broadcast location in Mercury , so long thought to be a planet , now turned out to be a solar power plant , we discovered the directed energy beams that pulsed off it with mathematical regularity those allowed us to find the rest . <newline> The Kuiper belt turned out to have millions of drone satellites circling in it , whether the satellites or the belt came first has not been determined , but that it was one of these that killed Voyager was not in debate . Spectroscopic analysis of the beam that killed our first extra solar ''ship '' showed us whole new vistas of wavelengths and frequencies and immediately both regressed and massively advanced our understanding of the universe . "
" For the first decade we panicked as new discoveries and the realization of your overpowering technology was uncovered day after day , Saturns rings were found to contain uncountable nanites , Jupiter had several ''somethings '' lurking deep in the gas layers and on and on , with each power transfer from Mercury we found some new , and horrifying . <newline> So we worked , feverishly , to try and counter each new discovery . We launched massive radiation cannons to fire focused x-rays at the nanites and sunder their atomic bonds , we used every nuke on the planet to bombard the 13 Jupiter locations until Mercury no longer tried to charge them , these and a thousand other plans and schemes were launched some successful , some not . The Moon has proved particular difficult as it seems to be a massive piece of machinery that we dare not attack as forcefully as is needed lest we doom ourselves with radioactive bombardment , now we walk its surface in the thousands digging and prying trying to exploit its mechanical depths and destroy it from within . We have not yet managed to enter it but even scratching the surface has revolutionized the sciences of chemistry and metallurgy , indeed most of the new weapon systems being made rely on the alloys and materials the saboteurs so carefully pry free . "
" Since the ''frantic 30 's '' the Earths people have calmed and the threat of an outer power has united us in ways never dreamed of by even the most idealistic of politicians , war after all is good for the economy and we are facing a war unlike any ever dreamt . We have united under one government and one language , Esperanto for so long a joke is now how scientists and engineers the world over share their thoughts and advances and the general population is quickly following suit . Massive engines of war have been created and sadly in our desperation for materials many rare and vulnerable species have been destroyed though we have saved as many seeds and as much D.N.A as possible , should we win we will bring them forth again . We have conquered disease and are close to becoming functionally immortal so much the better to build weapons and crew ships , and the ships themselves ... massive daggers of barely contained fusion power that even as we speak race to the Kuiper belt to see what may be done . "
" Now our thoughts turn to you , whomever you should be that threaten us from the sky , we know that Mercury beamed a tremendously powerful signal upon Voyagers destruction and we know the star that the signal travels to . Constrained as it is by light we know that we have another 63 years before it reaches you and we thought you should know what have accomplished and how much of your technology we have defeated in a mere 27 years . You may be already on the way to us when you receive this trailing broadcast but the Earth and all its people want to tell you with one voice ''Come fucking get some ! '' .

" Genuinely surprised , Rohan turned his gaze from his sandwich , to the document , then to Agent M. M 's brown eyebrows clenching furiously that they seemingly meet in the center . In his heavy Indian accent , Rohan replied , `` Ahh , Michael ! I did n't expect to see you here . '' "
 `` Keep your volume down . '' 
" `` Since you 're already here , why do n't you go enjoy the comic con , take a break ? '' "
" `` Look , you 're the one who gave me this job , why ? '' "
" `` You remember Naimoli , right ? His group recently lost half a million , M. Half of their annual profit ! A couple of the other guys tracked down transaction , and apparently , your little miss innocent here is to blame . You may be a fan of Ceesharp , and she may have kept your hand clean of a few people , but she messed with the wrong people . Naimoli was n't even gon na use that money to fund his little gang , he was saving it for retirement . This mission is n't a request , it 's an order , now go ! We 're done here . '' Rohan , finished his sandwich , then began to walk towards the line for the costume contest . Agent M headed slowly towards the exit , still unsure about his assignment . "
" Anita Devose , more commonly known as the hero Ceesharp , is n't a murderer , a rapist , or a thug . She is and a thief , but she never took a dime from her gains , they were donated to those less fortunate . Whenever she was n't stealing money , ms. Ceesharp would be using her skills to expose the criminals in Virgo , a city infested with black market traders , murderers , rapists , and thieves . Agent M is a fan of her work . Even though she may not realize it , Ceesharp has spared countless lives from Agent M 's hands . Borr the strong , Harry the psycho , and Katie the murderer , were amongst the many people arrested before Agent M was assigned to eliminate them . "
" Agent M parked his car a block from the designated house . He made sure to bring along his trusty Mark 23 , a hunting knife , a rope , and a few cyanide pills . The walk from the car to the house passed by quickly for Agent M. He felt a rush of adrenaline , causing his hands to shake . He used the imitation key Rohan has provided , and silently opened the door . The lights were off , no appliances turned on , dishes from the previous night still rested on the sink . He quietly made his way upstairs , and opened the doors one by one . On the master bedroom , Agent M found Ceesharp soundly sleeping . She looked younger than her reported age of forty , she had dark skin , puffy black hair , quite beautiful according to Agent M. Because he had no intention to kill her , Agent M started to look around for around for clues for the stolen money . After about ten minutes of carefully rummaging through shelves , closets , and cabinets , Agent M turned his gaze towards the laptop . He powered it on and was surprised to find that it had no password . He went through Ceesharp 's highly organized note and found the information he needed . The money was sent to Jack , CEO of Virgo 's most popular construction company . Ceesharp planned to use the money towards building the city 's first homeless shelter and orphanage . "
" “ Maybe if I get the money from Jack , I wo n't have to kill her , ” Agent M thought to himself . Before he could turn off the laptop , he heard a scream . Ceesharp quickly ran towards her secret closet and acquired a pistol . She cocked the pistol , pointed the weapon at Agent M , and shot . Agent M laid on the floor , trying to contain the blood from his neck . "
" “ I know you 're here to get the money back ! , ” Yelled Ceesharp . “ HAH ! Naimoli is going to have to go through my dead body before he can stop me. ” "
" Agent M gazed at Ceesharp 's eyes and found no sense of hesitation . Ceesharp made a name for herself by her willingness to break the law for the greater good . On April 8th , 2015 , however , she unleashed her wrath at the wrong person . "
" When his life flashed before his eyes , Agent M realized that killing all those criminals , as bad as they may be , was not justice . Although he never got the chance to explain himself , he felt a sense of relief that he died at the hand of his hero .
The flowers are gorgeous , roses , a ravishing red crimson perfume set against lush dark green stems , wrapped in baby 's breath and tissue and hand-tied love . Theres a bow too . It 's extravagantly twirled halfway up , with a little crisp white card attached . They look smashing . "

" <newline> He does n't listen . He ca n't of course , stuck in time as we put him ... . "
 <newline> Silly us . Well let 's see what else we can see . 
" <newline> His hands are free fiddling with the lock . Key 's not fitting . His suit 's nicely cut - a real gentleman 's suit . Top class . Shoes , spick and span and shiny . A smart tie , with the expensive looking silkish ? material . Not your average office bloke then . Though he does have that whitesh , pale face with the dark eyes you get when you spend a lot of time inside staring at a screen for hours at a time . "
 <newline> And he 's sweating a little . There 's a tremble in his fingers . And ... 
 <newline> And ... 
 <newline> And ... 
 
 And ... ..

You might ask me if all the suffering , all the destruction is worth of our desire to be independent nation . My answer is that our liberty is not a mere whim , but a matter of life and death . We could have lived in a state with a government which treats their people as human beings . But we no longer can nor want to be ruled by monsters to whom a life has no value whatsoever . All they care about are profits from the mining . Noone on Earth bats an eye when a fifteen year old dies ten kilometers below the surface as long as the precious metals keep flowing and an Earth kid has his new gadget for a birthday present . USA has always been a predator , pillaging entire countries with zero regard for those who live in it . They had been holding Mars colonies in iron fist , employing war criminals to keep us in line . They had been promising to make our lives bearable , but alas the agreements with Americans are worth less than a paper they are written on . Therefore , I declare the creation of Independent State of Mars . It 's better to die fighting than living on your knees .
She wakes up in stages . The light in the cottage bends along the curves of her shoulders and I wonder if there could ever be anything in the world as soft as this . The door to the patio is open and spring breezes carry in the smells of a world being reclaimed . Whatever I was thinking about is long gone . She makes a how-about-coffee kind of noise while stretching out across the bedsheets . "
" “ Sure . Same as normal , or something different ? ” "
 “ Why ? ” 
 “ Well ... because things are different today . You know ? ” I get up and consider putting clothes on as I talk . “ This is the beginning of a whole new life for us. ” 
" “ I think— ” she clears her throat , “ that it 's going to be a whole new life with the same milk , no sugar. ” "
 “ Hmm. ” I 'll stay naked . “ I can see this is n't going to work out then. ” 
 She rolls over and drops her face into the pillow . Whatever she says does n't sound very perturbed . She makes me smile so easily . I think that 's the real mystery of it . Everything I 've done in life and she can make me warm and fuzzy by muttering into a pillow . I 'm insane . I 'm in love . You have even my smile to entertain yourself with . 
" She bought me one of those plastic cup/single serving machines but I threw it out . That was a little testy but it 's disgustingly wasteful . She conceded when I pointed out the volume of shelf space the cups take up . The relative density to traditional packages . Better , I think , just to not drink the stuff , but life is not all about efficiency . It 's a balance . We respect each others ' boundaries . A lot of my work seems to teach me about successful relationships—or at least the thinking about work . "
" I got a french press instead and , though I find myself making the coffee most of the time , I like the doing of it . There are steps , and flourishes . All the meaning in life is made—crafted . Living itself is a craft to be mastered . As I pour out hers I realize I 'm daydreaming and check the time . I could miss almost anything to spend a few more hours in bed with her . Almost . "
" She 's asleep again when I come back into the room . “ Coffee , babe. ” She sits up reluctantly and takes her mug , careful not to spill it onto her chest . The image of a drip of coffee rolling down her chest as she blows steam from the cup is an incredible turn-on . She notices . "
" “ We 've got stuff to do today , no more of that. ” "
 “ I know . I was just ... ” I do n't know what I was just . “ I 'm so glad I 've earned your trust. ” 
" She sips , furrowing her brow . “ You 're shit at saying romantic things. ” "
 “ Would you rather I did n't try ? ” 
" She smiles so warmly I lose my mental attempt to lose the erection . “ Hey , what time is it ? ” "
 “ We 've got time. ” I set my drink on the bedside table and sit down . She leans over and gives me a sweet kiss on my cheek . The aroma lingers . 
 “ Get dressed. ” 
" She finishes the coffee and starts moving around the room , getting her clothes . My suit 's already laying on the chair . I 'm dressed well before she is , admiring the cut of the jacket in the bathroom mirror . I have to edge past her as I step out to let her in . I step out onto the porch and pull out a smoke . If I have to give it up , I 'll at least finish the ones I have left . My watch beeps . I wish the car was here already . Probably only a few minutes out . I 'm flicking the lighter when her voice comes out muffled from the bathroom . "
 “ What ? ” I pull it out of my mouth from habit . 
 “ Where are my earrings with the red stones in them ? ” 
 “ I do n't know . Did you take them out ? ” 
 “ I think so. ” 
 “ Well forget about them . You 're just perfect as you are. ” 
" She makes a loud puking sound but she comes out and floats around the bed to join me . The valley to the south is alive with the waves of wind that tear across the canopies , warm and dry . In the distance , on the low hills , I can see cattle grazing . There 's pollen in the air . It 's a smell that makes you breath greedily . My watch beeps again and I drop to my knee . "
 “ What now ? ” 
" “ I want to give you the brightest diamond in the world , but every time I found one it ended up just being another trinket . Junk for consumption. ” "
 “ This is my diamond ? ” 
" “ Yes .
He sat in a stark room with his old friend , the paper cup of water spilled on the floor . It had been years since they splashed in puddles together , climbed book cases , rode a wagon , or threw a water balloon . "
" They talked about the girl in class , how they used to play house as kids . They talked about the babysitter , show and tell , and making up answers on tests . They talked about making `` art '' out of snow , snowball fights , stories his dad used to tell them , and how , `` Life builds character . '' "
" They remembered the time mom let him smoke , and the time they played cards with a marked deck . They talked about the machines they built together as kids . ( Oh , how they were ahead of their times ! ) They talked about visiting other planets , and dinosaurs , and x-ray guns . "
 They talked about the life lessons his friend taught him - how to be thankful for the little things in life and hugs . 
" They stared at their reflections , then hugged , a final goodbye . "
" He whispered , `` Not so hard , you big sissy , you 'll squeeze my tears out . ''
Be calm Sarah , there is nothing to be worried about . "
" I sat in the student-pickup loop , repeating these words as nothing but foreign cars past by . My mother was usually the first person in line , but today that streak was broken . In fact , I had been sitting on this bench for almost 20 minutes , and still she refused to dispel my growing fear . "
" I almost started hyperventilating when all of a sudden from the corner of my eye , I spotted my crush . Trevor Miles , Mr. Popular but still talked to everybody without fear of judgement . He was perfect in a rugged way ; his dreadlocks and slight 5 O'clock shadow danced with his perfect lips and infinite eyes . I once was caught in his gaze when he picked up a pencil I dropped in homeroom , and I felt like I was going to go insane if I kept staring any longer . "
" All of a sudden he noticed me staring at him , and I quickly looked away trying to be as smooth as possible . I guess I failed , because he started walking towards me now . Oh god , no . I am already panicking Trevor , please do n't finish me off . "
" `` Hey Sarah , your mom did n't come already ? That 's a first , I 'm normally the last person here . '' he said with his unfair smile , destroying any semblance of control I had over my manic state . "
" `` Uhh ... yeah . I guess she got caught in traffic or something . Or maybe her car did n't agree with her driving habits and went on strike or ... '' I said before shutting my idiotic mouth . I never had a boyfriend all throughout high school , and I swore it was my inability to just play it cool . Every time I started mouthing off clever jokes , they were met with laughs , but subsequently all the date offers whizzed past me . I could see him smirking at my comment , and I accepted that my future with him ended so abruptly . "
" He started since I stopped talking , `` Ah well no matter , its cool to have someone else here with me for once . Remind me to thank your mom 's car for the company . '' "
" I giggled , but for a fleeting moment . This smooth son of a bitch did n't understand how rude he was being . Someone so cool , trying to flirt with someone like me as if anything will come of it . Sure I was pretty , but my social standing was anything but . He was maneuvering like I wo n't catch feelings and hope that I could actually be his girlfriend , and that all the girls would n't treat me like shit after seeing him giving me attention . It was cruel in hindsight , harmless in the moment . "
" `` Well , I just hope she 's alright . It 's freezing out here . '' I muttered under my breathe . "
" He saw me starting to shiver when the wind blew , and responded , '' Do you want my jacket ? I 'm fine . '' "
" No you asshole , I do n't want your pity attention . "
" `` S ... .sure , thanks . '' "
" He wrapped his warm coat over me , and lightly cuddled with me on the bench , like the unaware douche bag he was . I hated him , but I was warm . "
" I sat with him for about 10 more minutes until my mother arrived , and I had just remembered I was freaking out about her moments ago . Trevor completely erased my worry , so quickly I forgot something might have actually happened to her . She jumped out of the BMW , apologizing profusely , going on about her car randomly dying on the highway . Trevor smirked , and I elbowed him in his side , laughing to myself . Just before I got in the car , and right as my mom turned her back , Trevor whipped me around and gave me a light kiss right on my forehead . "
" `` Wh ... what the hell was that for ? '' I asked , slightly angered while my heart was racing . "
" `` Well I thanked the car ... .. might as well thank you too . You can keep my jacket till tomorrow Sarah , I 'll get it back from you after 2nd period . '' he said , looking towards the entrance of the school as his sister pulled into the loop . "
" `` But everyone will think- '' I started , but he stopped me . "
" `` Exactly , now go home girl . '' he said with his god damn smirk . "
 I hated him more than ever . 
" `` Alright lover boy , see you tomorrow . '' I said , wincing at my terrible comeback . "
" I got in the car , flustered , and promptly berating my mother for being late , followed by requesting she picked me up later from now on . "
 
" ( I am a male , so sorry if it sounds exaggerated ) "

The Sky and the Earth looked at each other , longing and yet separated for eternity . "
" The sky looked down at the beautiful earth . He whispered to her and his breath washed over her face and created waves in her seas , `` Why ca n't we get closer ? Why ca n't we join ? This eternal distance . This love . This want . This thirst . '' "
" The earth replied to the handsome sky , `` Suppose we say we become one , my darling . Suppose we touch , suppose we join , then we shall be one , not two . "
" We shall join , you shall complete me and I you . We shall no longer be two , we shall be one , in perfection . And then what ? "
" The thirst will quench . The bliss shall be tasted . But there would be no want . No love . No thirst , anymore . '' "
" And thus the Sky and Earth looked at each other with longing and remained untouched for eternity , keeping the thirst alive .

" It ’ s ironic , don ’ t you think , having to pretend to be a Jew after what we did ? "
" Of course I know what happened . Like everyone else , I didn ’ t believe it at first . "
" Adler , yes , Adler , the guard from block A , he used to be an SS , as you know , he ’ s the one who told me about it . He said I needed to know everything so that you would believe me . So I asked him , and he told me . We would sit together , a couple of times a week , he would tell me the stories , and I would take notes . "
" Of course , it would have been easier to pay someone off , but I couldn ’ t afford it . Not anymore . We lost everything during the war . Because my father was a doctor , and my mother ’ s family owned stores , we weren ’ t hit too badly after Brest-Litovsk and Versailles . My father was a good man , and a hard worker . He was wounded at Cambrai , and he was young , so he recovered , even though his lungs never really did . Luckily , it was too late in the war for him to be sent back . "
" No , he wasn ’ t a Nazi . He ’ d seen enough . My mother didn ’ t like them , either , they thought they were vulgar . Of course , they couldn ’ t tell me that . But they tried to stop me from joining the youth groups . I didn ’ t understand . They ’ d told me to say I wasn ’ t interested . But I was . So I told the teacher , Fraülein Grüber I wanted to join . They were furious , and they couldn ’ t show it . But I felt it , and I didn ’ t understand . I mean , Staatssekretär Von Schirach was her third cousin , once removed , what was there not to be proud of ? Maybe I could be like him , too - after all , it was in my blood , too… One day , when we were out on a field exercise , I told Hanz about it . And that idiot Hanz told Heinrich , because he wanted to suck up to him . And Heinrich told his cousin Fritz , who was jealous of me and Lieselotte , I guess . But I ’ ll never be sure why he told his father . They came early in the morning . With what they found , Vater was lucky that my mother had some pull , in a way - he was given the choice . He figured he would be more useful on the Eastern front . And he never came back . "
" She managed to smuggle herself to Switzerland with Konstanze , we have family there , you see , and they told everyone else he died of pneumonia on the train , of course . The party trusted me now . But I didn ’ t trust them anymore . I didn ’ t have another choice than to pretend . And wait for the right time . I got lucky in Poland , many times . We were retreating . A family hid me from the Russians . And then I made my way here . "
" I was worried I would be arrested if I went back to Germany . And there was nothing left there for me , anyway . Our house is gone . My family is is gone . So I hid , in plain sight . I went to the cafés , went back to university , learned to paint . "
" What do you mean , “ just like the Führer ” ? Not at all ! The Führer would have had the Schule des Sehens burnt down , and everyone arrested , and I was there studying with the others this summer . Of course , the faculty has been gutted . I mean , Vienna isn ’ t Freiburg . And yes , of course Heidegger joined the party . At the time , I was as disgusted as anyone else , but I too had to play a part , and I figured he was playing his . Anyway , it isn ’ t like importing German professors because they can ’ t find jobs back home bothers the administration , or the Austrians going to Germany bothers us , right ? "
" Yes , I heard that some of your guards had come back as well , I heard about Adler . He ’ s a smart man . He kept the numbers of those whom you registered , but died after you liberated the camps . Of course , he made sure the bodies couldn ’ t be found . Quite a miraculous recovery some of them made , don ’ t you think ? But the truth is , there is no other choice for people like me . Because of what happened with my father , Mutti never replied to the letters I sent her . Konstanze , either . So I don ’ t have a family anymore . Here , there is no future . "
" Of course , I ’ m less of a victim than the Jews were ! Yes , yes , I understand that what I did was bad . But I was also honest with you . I told you what I know about Adler

" Topluk hunched over the communicator and tapped frantically at the controls . Even encrypted as it was , sending the message over all available channels was a clear breach of protocol… but this was too big , too potentially disastrous to risk the message not getting through . His cerebral implants hummed softly as they synced with the device in front of him and uploaded both his warning and his memory logs . The lights in the tunnel dimmed slightly as the communicator opened a miniscule singularity and established a connection with the listening post a few light years away . One minute passed , then another . "
 He felt the chill of the voice before he heard it . 
 *Acknowledged . * 
" His implants went dead and Topluk tucked the device away . Swallowing the bile at the back of his throat , he walked back into the control room amid raucous hollering . One of the humans charged at him , teeth bared , and Topluk flinched instinctively . The human stopped short and wrapped its arms around him , uttering a barking laugh as it did so . “ We did it , Paul ! We actually fucking did it ! ” "
" Topluk bared his teeth in a smile . *Such repulsive creatures , * he thought as he shook the human ’ s hand . “ That we did. ” "
" The human turned his attention to a monitor nearby . “ Counter-clockwise circuit is almost complete . Had some fluctuations with the cryogenics a few minutes ago , but everything ’ s running great now. ” He turned back to Topluk , frowning . “ You feeling alright , Paul ? You look a little green. ” "
" “ Fine , ” Topluk replied . “ Just more excitement than I ’ m used to. ” A familiar hum echoed in his mind . “ I ’ m gon na go grab a bite to eat , ” he said as he edged toward the door . "
 The human nodded . “ I ’ ll catch up in a few. ” 
" It was everything Topluk could do not to sprint down the hall . As soon as he found a secluded nook , he fished out the communicator and downloaded the message from Central command . "
 *Projections revised . Prognosis dire . Completion of project ahead of our predictions suggests underestimation of human ingenuity and perseverance . Immediate action required . *

" “ Sectors one , six , and seven at nominal field strength. ” "
" The crowd murmured excitedly . Topluk felt a bead of sweat trace its way down his forehead , but ignored it . "
 “ Two and eight on their heels. ” 
" Time crawled to a halt . Five down , three to go . *Please , * Topluk thought . *Please . * "
 “ Sector five is up and running ! ”

 “ Magnetic quench in sectors three and four . God *damnit . * ”

When I was young , I was obsessed with lucid dreaming . I would always browse the internet for tips and instructions on how to achieve that coveted state - where one was in full control of a fake reality . I imagined nightly trips to exotic worlds , and a place where I could stand up to the bullies and always , always get the girl . "
" I gave it up after the first night . Instead of being transported to a beautiful fantasy the beckoned at my every whim , I became frozen in place within my own body , forced to watch as malicious creatures seemed to crawl towards the bed . I felt something sit on my chest , slowly and inexorably exerting pressure . *Oh* . My breathing drew up short . *So* . I felt as if I would throw up . *Slowly* . I could 've sworn that I heard a rib crack . "
" Of course , when I woke up I found that none of those things had actually happened . I was fine , and what I had experienced was simply a side effect of attempting to reach a lucid dream state . Needless to say , I did not try ever again , and slept with my parents for a few weeks afterwards . "
" I never did forget that feeling of helplessness , though . Watching what was happening , fearing the inevitable , with no power to stop it . "
" I 'm a grown man now . It has been many years since I was last afraid of the dark . Since I last thought of helplessness , and creatures in the night . But now I remember again . Now I am afraid . "
" It was such an innocent looking thing . A tiny chip . It could 've been anything - my optical implant , intelligence enhancement , hormone regulation . In fact , if I were any other person , I probably would 've just shrugged it off . But I knew . It could not have been any of those things . "
 How long had it been there ? The question burned in the back of my mind . Who had put it there ? What did they stand to gain ? 
" Was my whole life a lie ? Did I truly have any free will ? How long has this thing been influencing me for ? Which decisions were my own ? Did I really love my wife ? Do I really like my job , my children , my friends ? "
 I have to get it out . I know how ; I 've done it before with more complex implants . I just need access to my workshop and time .

What if we were *all* the playthings of some person or group , being directed and nudged towards certain goals ? What if they could tell that my little light had gone dark on their screens ? "
" No , it 's too dangerous to take it out right away . Not until I know more . "

" I did some diagnostics last night . The chip definitely is some kind of control apparatus . It gets a little ping from an unknown signal , adjusts dopamine and hormone levels *just so* when the target thinks of something in particular - be it a job , a person , or what-have-you - to influence them into making certain choices . Then , like the good little machine it is , it sends a return 'ping ' to confirm success or failure . "
" I thought of my wife first , fingers trembling on the receiving device that I had built out of spare parts and an old radio . "
 *Ping . * 
 My children . 
 *Ping . * 
 My job . 
 *Ping . * 
 My ambitions . 
 *Ping . * 
 The shit I took an hour ago . 
 *Ping . * 
 Huh . Must be something wrong with the damn thing .

" I got the machine working a few hours later . It 's still on in my workshop , crackling static every once in a while and emitting a faint light . "
" I tested it out . I 'd rather not talk about the results , but it will suffice to say that a lot of who I am is not entirely my own . "
" I 've spent the last week thinking about it . If someone out there really does control my chip , and potentially others ' , surely I could n't do anything about it ? Even if I removed mine , I would be stuck in a world where I did n't belong , miserable in an otherwise happy society . "
" I mean , I 'm pretty damn happy , right ? My wife loves me , my kids are amazing , and my job pays well . If this is life as a puppet , I ca n't think of anything I 'd rather be . "
 I 'm going to destroy the damn receiver . 
 I 'm going to leave the chip in . 
" I 'm going to try to forget it
My eyes close , the pain fades , and I rest for a while . "
" What wakes me is a shuffling sound . It 's the sound sandals make when they 're dragged across a stone floor . Oilsmoke fills my nostrils , and heat presses in on my skin . "
 I open my eyes . 
" Torches in sconces on the walls light the stone room . The ceiling hangs six inches above my head . Wooden tables are evenly spaced throughout the room . Every table is set with six wooden bowls , wooden spoons , and wooden cups . Rushes cover the ground . Dirt pokes up through the spaces between their fronds . The shuffling comes from somewhere past one of the walls . "
 “ Hello ? ” I call out . 
" I hear a sharp yelp , much like the sound a dog makes after its tail has been stepped on . “ Who 's that ? Who 's there ? ” The man 's voice has the texture of pocket lint – worn , grey , fragile . "
 “ I do n't know how I got here. ” 
" “ Neither do I , ” the man says . The shuffling begins again and not long after he comes around the corner of the wall . His robes might once have been white , but they 've become so stained I mistake them at first for burlap . His beard reaches to his belly-button , and it houses dust , twigs , and bits of bread . He comes right up beside me and peers into my face with his watery blue eyes . “ You 're dead. ” "
" He says it matter-of-fact , not as a question or a exclamation , but rather the way a droll teacher might address a student who has arrived late to class . "
" “ I fell down those stairs at the tram station . I know that much , ” I say . “ But if I 'm dead , how come I 'm here and talking to you ? ” "
" “ That should be pretty obvious , should n't it ? ” The man pulls his beard apart with his two hands and reveals a silver medallion on a leather thong . The medallion reads Santo Petra . "
 “ This is heaven ? ” 
 He snorts . “ It was. ” 
 “ Was ? ” 
" “ Nobody comes here anymore . God 's had the place decomissioned . He 's built a newer , better heaven and said he 'd have no need for me as gatekeeper anymore. ” "
 “ This is a joke . You 're joking. ” 
" “ One of the newer saints , some Italian hotshot who wears leather vests and gels his hair in points , recommended that God dandy up the place , and , would n't you know it , but after millenia of asking the big guy to make some changes , he goes and decides to build a whole new heaven . Now they 've got Saint Guido on the door and I 'm left here to tend to the furniture and to move along the sad cases like yourself who end up here. ” Saint Peter slumps onto a wooden bench . He picks a bowl up , waves his hand over it , and desultorily begins spooning up the stew that appears inside . “ You 'll be wanting to move along now , wo n't you ? Off to Heaven 2.0 ? The big party in the sky ? I do n't think they even call it heaven anymore , to be honest . It 's got some greasy hip name , something like Blade or FaNaTiK . Ridiculous. ” He waves his spoon around and fails to notice the glob of stew that falls into his beard . "
" “ Does n't sound all that great , to be honest . Probably lots of loud music , tight clothes , and orange people ? Not really my scene. ” "
" Saint Peter shakes his head . “ Oh , they all say that , but after a couple of years they come around . Just last year I had a dyed-in-the-wool social reject in here – this guy had n't left his house or showered in five years . He died from an infection he got from pooing in the bathtub – was in H2.0 for two months and he made the decision to lose the weight , orange up the skin , and hit the dancefloor . Unbelivable . But it goes to show you 'll be happy if you move along. ” "
" I join him on the bench . “ For real , that sounds terrible . I 'd rather hang out in the quiet here with you. ” "
 “ You ca n't be serious. ” 
 “ Really I am . I 'm a quiet book person . Noise is the last thing I want to be around for eternity. ” 
 Saint Peter looks left and right out of the corners of his eyes . “ Definitely ? ” 
" “ Yah , for sure . Get me some old robes and pass me some stew. ” "
" “ Call it off , everybody. ” Saint Peter gets to his feet . “ Call it – ” An air horn cuts him off . "
" A banner unfurls behind Saint Peters table . YOU JUST GOT PUNK 'D ! The stone in the walls around me collects into drips and drops and they spread out in puddles on the floor . The rushes fade away and what 's left
I like hard work . Makes me feel alive . So many years and I grew bored with pretty much anything . Sitting around and doing nothing , being rich while doing that , being poor , being homeless . You get bored of doing nothing . Then you start working , you get bored of that too . There 's places to see and people to meet , but the first are limited and the second tend to die on you . If you 're doing drugs every day for a hundred years they become mundane and boring . You get tired of sex . Want to try new things because normal ones do n't excite you anymore so you try new things and keep doing that until you 've run out of things to try . The most depraved acts humans can come up with do n't even make you blink anymore . You 've read all the books worth reading and saw all the movies worth seeing . You end up reading trashy novels and and watching porn movies for the plot . Anyway , now I 'm an office man , working for this big company . I was bored and ready to quit from day one , hour one . People do this for years ?
I promised I would never abandon her . With tears in her eyes and scars on her arms , she would blame me . I was the reason she was depressed . I was the reason she lost all her friends . I was the reason she felt the need to harm herself . "
" You know what her definition of abandonment was ? Not messaging her on Facebook for three whole days . That 's all it took . Three days , and she tells me that she no longer wants to be friends anymore . "
 Fine . That is honestly the way it should be . We would both be better off not not having each other in our lives . We were free . 
 Or so I thought . 
" It was all just a passive-aggressive , manipulative trick . Once again , I was the bad guy for not trying to get her to forgive me . How could I be so insensitive to her feelings ? I 'm a horrible person , and she 's the only one who will forgive me . Not my sister , not my best friend , not my parents . I 'm nothing without her . "
" So I did what I though was right : I abandoned her .
This may be horrible "
" He lay there dying my mother next to him , the doctor said that the crash would probably kill him , and my mother I loved them both , my dad motioned for me and said there is something i need to tell you I had known him my whole life , I thought that I know him , but then ; He said it he told the story . I have never told you this but I feel that i need to , or I will die a mystery . When i was young i was orphaned this was not because my parents were bad I suspect or perhaps i just want to believe that I do n't know when , but i was put in a foster home run by a gay couple of whom i remember very little of but from my few memories is that they were great , caring tolerant people who loved everyone . However when i was about 4 I was moved to a new foster home . These foster parents strictly upheld hierarchy where the “ man of the house ” was at the zenith and i was at the bottom , I was at the time told it was because i was evil and and doomed to hell , at the time i had nothing else to believe so i believed them . They convinced the other kids that i was evil and needed to be punished i was beaten almost daily by both the kids and the parents , i was lead to believe that i was just bad and that it was just how life was . around when i was 18 i left . at first i thought that i would just live and life would be the same but when a social worker asked about my experience i told her the whole story the whole time just assuring her that it was a normal life while explaining my horrible life . she said that that was horrible and she had had a similar experience . And we talked about life and as i readjusted to life she helped me realise that i did n't need to be like my parents . She later quit and we started hanging out then eventually we started dating.And that is how i met your mother my mother smiled as they held hands and with that they closed their eyes and my father shed one tear . I had no idea about this , this left me wondering if i really knew that man or my mother , it left me wanting to have more time , but I could n't , I wanted to forget that moment and remember him as the man i thought i knew but I couldnt , he was gone . <newline>
I stepped out of the shuttle pod and onto the smooth metal of the landing pad near the top of our apartment complex . My hover suitcase followed me faithfully , floating from the vehicle 's rear boot before the lid closed automatically behind it . With a loud hum from its antigravity turbines , the hovercar took off , shooting off down into the city centre . "
" I walked across the wide landing pad , which jutted out like a chromed lily pad from the side of the elegantly curved building . My cloak rippled slightly in the breeze as the double doors slid open silently ahead of me . The thick blue carpet felt soft beneath my booted feet , and I stood there for a moment , just breathing in the familiar faint scent of vanilla that wafted up from the freshly cleaned floor . "
" I smiled to myself as I strolled across to the elevator , which was already waiting with its doors open , and selected my floor . A few seconds later , I was stepping out into a different corridor and walking down the hall to our apartment . I placed my palm upon the lock , which winked green and beeped . The door slid back to reveal the spacious room beyond . "
" I stepped through , the suitcase coming to a stop beside me and gently lowering itself to the floor . "
" 'I 'm back ! ' I called , shrugging off my cloak and throwing it over a nearby table . There was no reply . "
" 'Rebecca ? ' I said , walking towards the short passage that led to the bedroom my girlfriend and I shared . I thought I had heard whispering a moment before , but now I could pick up no sounds coming from behind the door . "
" I crept up to the door , pushed it open and peered inside . My eyebrows rose in surprise . "
" On the wide , low bed lay my girlfriend Rebecca , with my other friend Kelly sitting with her back against the headboard on the adjacent pillow . Some sort of device lay on the covers in the centre of the bed , a sort of capsule or something . It was spherical , with tiny golden lights winking on and off inside like a swarm of trapped fireflies . "
" 'Hey , ' said Rebecca , smiling dreamily . 'You 're back early . ' "
" 'What the hell are you doing ? ' I said , coming to the foot of the bed and looking at the capsule more closely . "
" Kelly and Rebecca exchanged glances . 'You tell him , ' said Kelly , hugging her knees . "
" 'Okay , ' said Rebecca , looking back at me . 'Luke , have you ever heard of hive minds ? ' "
 'Hive minds ? ' I repeated . 'Sure . ' 
" 'Well , Kelly and I were talking about them , and we decided to research them a little . They 're actually really cool , Luke ! ' she said excitedly , her eyes lighting up . 'People who have joined them say it 's like nothing you 've ever imagined . You can hear other people 's thoughts , and they can hear yours , and everyone helps make each other 's decisions , and— ' "
 She stopped when she saw the look on my face . 
" 'So what is this ? ' I said , pointing to the capsule . "
" 'It 's a relay , ' she replied . "
 'A relay for what ? ' 
" 'This . ' She turned her head to her left , revealing a round metallic disc attached to her scalp just behind her right ear . Tiny lights flickered in it , similar to those inside the relay capsule . My eyes widened . "
" 'I 'm linked in too , ' interjected Kelly , turning her head so that I could see the identical device on the side of her head . I looked back to Rebecca in disbelief . "
" 'You two are in a *hivemind* together ? ' I said . 'Like , actually linked to each other ? ' "
" 'And about two dozen other people , ' said Kelly . 'That 's what this relay is for . So we can keep in contact . ' "
" 'And you did n't think to maybe ask if I was OK with this ? ' I said to Rebecca . She did n't reply , but blinked a couple of times quickly . Kelly suddenly sniggered quietly . "
 I looked from one to the other . 'What ? ' I said . 'Are you two talking to each other right now ? ' 
" 'Us and the rest of them , do n't forget , ' said Kelly . 'There 's currently a bit of a debate going on as to whether she should try kissing and making up now , or let you cool off in your own time . ' "
" I did n't bother to reply , but instead stormed from the room , slamming the door behind myself . "
" Neither of them followed me , but then why would they ? They had found their own new little world .
Initially , I did n't think much of it . It was my first night visiting my parents ' home in over a year , and I was n't too familiar with the layout of the house . I figured it was my mother in the other room , probably clearing her throat as she tried to fall asleep . "
" But when I heard it again , I remembered : *My parents are n't home yet . * They had left earlier this evening to go see a play in the Opera House . I glanced over at the clock . It was n't even midnight yet . "
 A faint chill ran down my spine . If that was n't my mother coughing -- then who was ? Maybe it was just a squeaky pipe or something . I crept out of the guest bedroom and walked down the hall toward the adjacent room . I put my ear up against the door . 
" *Nothing . * Maybe it was my imagination ? I opened the door and swung it open . Inside was my dad 's study , dimly illuminated with an office lamp sitting on his desk . I glanced over at the piles of old papers stacked against the wall , a remnant of when my dad used to work for the city . . . "
" The sound came again . It was a faint woman 's cough , just like before . But this time it sounded like it was coming from the guest bedroom ! I ran out of the study and back into my room . There was nothing in there but my laptop and bed . "
" As if taunting me , the sound came a fourth time , coming from -- you guessed it -- the study room next door . `` God dammit ! '' I yelled out loud . I raised my fist and threw it into the wall . "
" I was n't expecting my hand to break through . The wall crumbled away like it was made of paper , and a large hole formed around my fist . Inside the wall , my hand had landed on something . . . sticky . A putrid smell surrounded my nostrils . I immediately recoiled . "
" From within the wall , a single shape appeared , illuminated by the dim light of the guest bedroom : a human eye , staring at me angrily . It blinked . "
" `` What the fuck ! ? '' I screamed out . I jumped away , running down the stairs and outside of my parent 's house . I ran down the front yard toward the street -- "
" A woman , dressed in black , appeared out of nowhere . It was dark , so her dirty face was only partially visible underneath the streetlamp . She had the same eye , staring at me . "
" I screamed , but nothing came out . The woman-thing approached me , her eyes burning into the back of my skull . She reached out a hand and touched my temples . "
" A vision flashed in my mind . A woman was laying in bed , coughing hysterically . `` Please , '' she said between gasps of air . `` I think I should go to the hospital . '' I did n't recognized her at first , due to her nappy hair and blotched skin , but soon the realization dawned on me : this woman in the vision was my mother . "
" My dad walked into the room , holding a glass of water . `` No , honey , '' he said . He turned away from my mother and removed a small vial from his coat pocket , pouring it into the glass of water . He turned back around and offered it to my mother . `` Drink this , '' he said . `` It 'll make that coughing go away . '' "
" My mom sighed . `` Ok , if you say so . '' She took a big gulp of it . "
" The image faded away . The next thing I knew , I was standing in the front yard , the woman-thing staring at me . A single tear fell from her cheek . `` Mom ? '' I said . "
" Then , it hit me . I had n't seen my mom yet since I came back . When I arrived earlier today , my dad told me she had already gone to see some friends before the show . `` She 'll really hate missing you , '' he said with a grin on his face . "
" The apparition disappeared as two bright headlights approached from down the street . It was my parent 's car , with only my dad sitting at the driver 's seat . He pulled into the driveway and got out of the car . `` Son ? What are you doing out here ? '' He said , walking towards me . `` Anyway , the show was great . Mom 's talking with director 's wife , you know how women are . '' He chuckled . `` So she probably wo n't be back until tomorrow morning . . . `` "
" `` Dad , '' I said , trying to compose myself . `` What did you do to mom ? '' "
 He curled his eyebrows . `` What do you mean ? I told you -- '' 
 `` No ! '' I said angrily . `` Did you kill her ? '' 
" My dad stepped back . `` Son , '' he said , a worried
`` What even is it ? '' the president asked the nervous scientists who had handed him the tablet in his hands . "
" `` Well '' they looked among themselves waiting for one to speak first `` We believe it 's like our arm , you can see by the mandibles and suction pads it 's capable of manipulating objects and holding on with great force . '' A voice came from the back of the group , as they made way for her . "
" `` So our first contact is a picture of it what ? Waving ? Is this some kind of language barrier test . Like establishing a shared dictionary of terms ? '' The president looked up at the scientist that answered , an older woman with graying hair and stern features . "
 `` Exactly so Mr President and that 's why I insist we respond likewise '' she answered excitedly . 
" `` Okay , have it done . Lets make sure we get off on the right foot with them , I want this to be a world changing event and for the better . "

 `` YOU DID WHAT ? ! '' Xarya 's displeasure radiated from her like heat from a star . 
" `` It was an accident , someone made their location the default '' I pleaded . "
" `` A dick pic , you sent a picture of your PENIS to Earth as our first contact ! AGGGHRGGHHH '' Xarya , fumed swinging her arms about knocking over various items on the bridge . "
 `` Sir '' Anat 's voice quietly interjected 
 `` WHAT ? '' she span with anger in her eyes . 
 `` The humans have responded '' He gulped 
" Xarya , stormed over , `` I 'm so embarrassed , please show me , have they demanded some kind of repayment for the insult ? '' Her face blushed as she took in the image before her . A long thin pink object that splayed at the end in five different ways , each of various thickness and length . "
" Anat spoke , `` Seems they sent us one back '' "
 `` Is it bigger than mine ? '' I asked 
"
Outisde their ramshacle shack Roland , Marissa , and their two children Tony and Susan are busy doing patchwork on their torn clothing . They children watch as a slow , feathery , flake falls to the ground . `` What is this dad ? '' The children ask , mouths agape "
" `` Well , '' Roland answers lips widening , `` Its a snowflake . '' HIs expression now unable to hide his smile . Its nots actually snow , its ash from whatever part of the city the Super Mutants are burning . "
 `` What 's snow ? '' 
 `` Snow is a sign from Saint Nick that he is coming soon '' <newline> Then the scavenger family was swallowed by the fire that was engulfing the city .

`` The exploders creep me out . '' "
 `` They prefer to be called humans . '' 
 `` Yeah ? And I 'd prefer to be called the Uber-Admiral of the 5th fleet . Does n't change the fact that those things are obsessed with explosions . '' 
" `` Are you talking about nuclear weapons ? Plenty of pre-FTLs have come up with those . I mean , even we went through times of violence and destruction . '' "
" `` Yes , we 've been violent , and yes , we 've blown things up . Still , we 've never felt the need to include explosions in every single significant invention we 've ever come up with . '' "
 `` I do n't follow . '' 
 `` Have you read my report on the Internal Combustion engine ? '' 
 `` I skimmed it . '' 
 `` It 's a way to propel their vehicles using explosions . They 're asinine . Hear about their firearms ? They 're ranged weapons that fling projectiles with explosions . '' 
 `` Does n't seem like it would be the most accurate ... '' 
" `` Oh , they figured out a way for it to work . They just could n't tolerate having anything like that centered around elasticity or magnetism ... just had to include an explosion in there . Hell , they have larger , but similar weapons that fling explosive devices with the aid of explosions . Some of those explosions explode into smaller devices that also explode . '' "
 `` Now you 're just making shit up . '' 
" `` No , look up 'Terran cluster bombs . ' '' "
 `` What the fuck ? '' 
" `` Oh , and get this : take a guess what they concluded once they discovered that all the visible galaxies were moving away from each other ... that the entire universe was the result of a really , really huge explosion . '' "
 `` ... The exploders creep me out . '' 
"
`` I can see angels , Mr. B . Angels flying in the sky ! '' I heard a girls voice say behind me after she drank from the chalice . "
" I got dizzy , my head started hurting and colors became intense as I floated out of my body . I saw some people sitting or laying down , heads thrown back as they were looking at the ceiling , tongues hanging out of their mouths as they gawked at the painted ceiling . "
" Higher I floated and saw some more people , running around in circles laughing , jumping for joy , dancing , expressing their intense joy . Some were kissing , making out all over the church , hooking up in the pews , and at least for puerile went into the confession booths . "
" I heard a fight break out . I do n't know what caused it , nor could I see it very clearly as the colors intensified around me and became white . "
" I vaguely heard a groan , and felt something being pressed into my chest . In a daze , I saw the little girl standing over me . Her face wore a a grotesque grin and her eyes glowed yellow . I heard the groan again , and saw a huge figure behind her wearing an oversized old fashioned scuba dive suit , that looked like it dated to the fifties . "
" Oversized as the suit was , there were multiple eyes on the helmet , and two wires formed a cage over the helmet . She was saying something again , and I felt an object pressing into me again . "
" I floated back to my body , the colors becoming less intense . The grotesque grin on the girls face began to look less like a grin and more into a gaping mouth , as though she were screaming in terror . "
" The big man behind her became less huge and oversized as I got closer to my body . Gone was the suit , the size , and when I reached my body , I saw that I had one of the candlebra sucking through my chest , candles scattered around , their melted wax leaving , oozing , pouring onto the floor . "
" The pastor looked in terror at the scene of violence and debauchery around him , and ran to his office . The little girl though , her eyes were still glowing yellow .

I hated him nearly as much as I hated myself . Stupid fat Yuki , the type of ham-fisted ball head triple chinned Jap that you see in animes being bullied , rather than in schoolyard brawls beating the shit out of the Gaijin . I did n't choose to be a Gaijin either , the kids here stuck it on like a label and decided never peel it off . I gave up Robbie , except at home , in the classroom , I was punk-Gaijin and *Lo-beh* to my teacher . They 've got a real problem with R 's and L 's on this side of the world . "
" The three o clock bell could n't have come faster . Shifting a look over my shoulder , I darted to the school corridor and for the hover board docking bay . "
" Lo and behold , fat head was waiting with two of his cronies . They stood near the hover board bay gate with arms folded and shark grins adorning their pudgy mugs . Yuki , the one in the centre , wore a black suit uniform with a white shirt that threatened to burst over his stomach . His two pals let their coats hang open and their collars twisted in all sorts of random angles . They were textbook baby Yakuzas and I was having none of it . "
" `` Step off , Yuki . Unless you want Principal Joku down here , '' I said , stopping two feet from the entrance . "
" Kids began piling through the school doors behind , only to notice Yuki and the Gaijin facing off before joining the crowd . "
 `` Kowai desu ka ? '' 
 *Are you scared ? * 
" The twerp knew enough english to make chit-chat , but he chose to respond in Japanese to make a point . You see , in this world you 're either Japanese or you 're not , and assimilating does n't allow you to make the cut . I was the sore thumb in a row of neatly curled fingers and in Japan there 's nothing worse than standing out . Yuki had taken it upon himself to make sure this problem would go away , and most of the other kids secretly agreed with him . Either that or they were too afraid to help out -- experience leant toward the former . "
" `` You 're not dumb enough to get kicked out of school ? Are you ? '' I asked , shifting back toward the crowd . "
" Yuki inched forward , a giant on the prowl . `` Anata no korosu tsumorida . '' "
 *I 'm going to kill you . * 
" Some of the kids in a rush had poked out from the sides of the crowd and past his cronies , into the docking bay . Now that the gate was open , I could maybe make a run for it . "
" `` Good thing fatsos ca n't run ! '' I yelled , turning and pushing into the crowd . "
" Yuki jumped for me , I felt a hand grip my bag but was able to shake it off . The kids drifted away , like water separating for the passage of a foreign body . In this case , it gave me more leverage to push into them and keep them in disarray , making the job difficult for Yuki . "
" His cronies joined the search , chasing for the yells from each student I bumped into . Someone pushed me and I rolled centre circle , only to notice Yuki and his pals on the other side of the students now and fighting to get to me . "
" I darted into the hover board bay , grabbed my Jetson 220 -- one of the latest and greatest . It could keep up with motorbikes and clamped your feet in so there was no fall-chance . This board was about as big as my forearm and its width was slightly longer than a skateboard . The jagged edges meant that it could slice grass and other frail material . "
 The board lit up red from my touch - owner recognition - and clamped me in as I jumped on . 
" Yuki and his Cronies were through the crowd now and beelining it for the hover board bay gate , no doubt they planned to shut me in . "
" I grinned at the idiots . There was nothing quite like the thrill , those few moments before the board shuddered to life and blasted from 0 to 100 . It 's the type of energy that preceedes a lightning strike or the tension that occurs right before elastic snaps . The board levelled out above the ground , thrusters powering on and causing the hair on the back of my neck to rise . "
" My heart thudded , both from the adrenalin and the thrill of the hoverboard . When I 'm on here , I forget who I am , and that there are people like Yuki in the world . For the sixty minute ride home I 'm away from Japan , and in my own reality , wherever I want the board to take me is where I go , and there 's nowhere out of reach . It 's a reminder that bad things are only temporary and that happiness always comes in the end . "
" I pushed forward with all my strength . The air around me cracked as I zipped out , swerving past Yuki and his cronies . There was a huge dust cloud in my wake , and the group of students were left
I was having a pretty normal vacation until today . I was lying at the beach , browsing Reddit and getting a tan . Suddenly , everything got dark and before I knew it , I heard the sound of a huge explosion and a lightning bolt flashed in front of my face . The shock traveled through my body and I fell to the ground . "
" I remember waking up in the emergency room of a hospital with a doctor standing beside carrying some papers . As I regain consciousness , I feel different in a way I ca n't explain . The doctor tells me that I 'll be fine and that no serious injuries occurred , thankfully . As I resume normal life , I feel infinite , like I can do anything if I set my mind to it . As I enter my house , everything seems to fall into place and I take a mental inventory of my life upto this point . This all happens in an instant . "
" I observe my surroundings , immediately , I notice everything wrong with my place and my body acts of its own mind and begins cleaning my apartment . I had wanted to do this at some point in my life , but now , I feel like there is no excuse for me not to do this . Fifteen minutes later , everything about my room seems so perfect and it looks like a place I would want to live the rest of my life in . I lay on my couch for a while , but I am restless . I want to do something , the first things that comes to mind is writing . Yeah , I am a writer , and yeah , I have not written a single word the past year . As I begin to write , everything seems to happen automatically . I put one word in front of another until I have written an entire chapter . When I glance at the clock , I realize how much time has passed , I was so lost in writing that time passed me by really quickly . "
" Immediately , I put on my workout clothing and go to the gym . As I walk there , I am thinking about how perfect of a day this will be . I am loving this . I am careful not to over-train as it is my first day but after the workout is finished , I feel a sense of accomplishment and this makes me really happy . A huge smile spreads across my face and I feel infinite . <newline> On my walk back home , I think of all the relationships in my life and how I was so careless about them . I make a decision to remedy this , I call up my best friend who I had not talked to for about a month and make plans to meet up at a nearby cafe . At first , he is a bit reluctant and aggressive about me not returning his calls . I apologize for my actions and explain to him how I want to maintain our friendship . I genuinely believed what I said . "
" I inquire about new developments in his life , how his wife and children are , how the new android application he is developing is working out . He seems to have changed a lot and appears happier . He tells me about his exciting adventures and how he works from home now and travels the world with his family . During the conversation , I , suddenly start to feel miserable . I try to cut the meeting short by claiming that I forgot about the important meeting I have tomorrow morning and I have to go to bed early . He seems completely okay with this and leaves me alone . "
" As I walk home , my head is constantly tilted down , not like in the morning , when it was proudly up . Tears start falling from my eyes for no reason I can think of . I begin to see everything negatively and believe that I was never truly happy at any point in my life , even today . As I enter my room , I close the lights and sit on my bed in darkness . I just want to think about my life . I start to think that today I was not me but someone else . I felt like an impostor . Suddenly , this feeling that life will not get any better in the future started to surface . Rationally , I knew this was not true but emotionally I was convinced . I do n't want to continue on living , I think to myself , if this is what life is . Life is meaningless , I tell to myself , the universe does n't care about you and that I am not a unique and special snowflake , that I am insignificant in the grand scheme of thing . The only honorable thing to do would be to kill myself , only in death can we be heroes . When I woke up , I never knew that suicide would be the thing I would set my mind to , but we do n't always get what we wish for . I proceed to jump out of my apartment window while keeping my eyes closed so that I do not back down from my decision .
The doctor always said I had a problem . What they meant by that , I do n't think I will ever know . I guess the way I live my life has n't been entirely right but in the end what can I do ? I live how I feel I should and will continue to do so . Unfortunately that type of thinking has placed me in Boarding Group B on American Airlines flight 1321 to Atlanta . Apparently there are people who explain to me what exactly I am doing wrong . Until then , here I am in line waiting to take my seats . After a while I notice a lovely blonde standing a few people in front of me . Maybe I should talk to her . Am I even capable of talking to a attractive woman ? I used to think so when I was a bit younger but after several bad rejections I think it would be best to just forget about her . Yet what is this ? She begins to show consideration for the family that stands behind and in front of her . `` You all can get in at the same time , I 'm by myself and I have no problem letting you guys get situated without me in the way . '' She says cheerfully . She is like a breath of fresh air . In my experience , with looks comes arrogance , yet with such a minor yet gracious act she begins to unravel my previous notions . Soon this wonderful creature stands before me . The smell of her perfume is intoxicating , almost to the point where I ca n't think straight . She hums quietly to her self as she puts on her ear buds . I can hear the muffled music playing from them but the sound suddenly stops after a few short moments . She seems frustrated as she removes her phone from her pocket only to notice that it had died . `` The battery is dead , damn . '' She says quietly . "
" Dammit , I can do it ! Say something ! `` That sucks . '' I say shakily . `` Did you forget to charge it ? '' She looks up from the blackened screen in front of her and removes an ear bud . `` Yeah , I guess so . '' She says with an awkward chuckle . I finally get a good look at her gorgeous green eyes , spectacular . `` I have a charger for that phone with me if you want to borrow it for a bit before we board , there are still a few more minutes left . '' She smiles slightly at my gesture of kindness causing my heart to throb uncontrollably . I can barely breathe . `` Thanks , but no thanks . It 's no big deal . I can read on the flight . '' She replies . All at once I am crushed . I never expected something so small to affect me so much . I smile back for a moment and return to my thoughts . How can someone in need reject such an offer . She obviously wants to listen to her music , and I have given her an offer that would satisfy her wants , yet she declines . Maybe I was wrong about her . She is just like the rest of them : arrogant , cold , disheartening . Her small and sensual frame must be her only true virtue . Everything she says must be an act of some kind , I know it . I can see it now in that beautiful yet deceitful gaze of hers , shes better than everyone else and she knows it . She does n't do anything out of kindness but out of pity for those she deems underneath her . <newline> While I drown in anger the plane begins to board . The line slowly moves forward as people ring their boarding passes . The succubus in front of me is next in line . She rings her pass and soon afterwards I do as well . As we walk down the ramp towards the whining engines of the jet liner I realize something . I had almost been taken in by the epitome of what causes me heartache . There is only one thing left to do . I must save others from feeling the same way I do . I ca n't allow her to sow more and more disdain . She 's small , and said she was traveling alone . Once we reach our destination I will become the champion of the heartbroken . I 'm sure my hands could fit around that elegant neck of hers quite easily , and due to her serious lack of appreciation for random acts from kind strangers , she is without a phone . "
" The doctors always said I had a problem ... ..
It has been some time since I last saw her . I get the occasional text with a nicety , and I send the occasional invite to some random event that she never shows up to . "
" I still care for her deeply , although not in the same way I once used to . I cheated on her once ; the girl who I cheated on her with is now my wife . That still bothers my wife . who does n't really like her ; as a result she 's met my baby boy once . I 'm kind of sad that the whole situation has gone down this path , but I love my wife and my son and refuse to put a wedge between us . "
" That 's when I heard the news . Her years of schooling , she found , was of no use to her anymore ; she found herself in an industry she hated , with no ladder in sight , let alone the opportunity to climb it . She 's perennially between jobs , and has not seen anyone since we split . Her father had a stroke several years back , and now her mother had been diagnosed with cancer . "
" I wish I could do something to help her . I wish I could be there for her . But I ca n't . This is her battle to fight , but I am left wondering why . She deserves better . She deserved better than me , too , but she really deserves better than what this life gives her .
Jerry H. Vah pulled into the parking lot of Amalgamated Multiverses , Inc . He was late . "
" The day had not started well . Actually things started to go down hill last night . He called home after work to say that he would not be home for dinner as he and some work friends were going out . His wife Sheila did not answer the phone , so he left a message and got on with his evening . She 'd be cool with him going out . Sure , it was Thursday , but it was a celebration at work . "
 That was the first mistake . First and second really . Sheila did not answer the phone because she was in the shower getting ready for their evening . It 's was their anniversary and she had made his favorite dinner and sent their son Joshua to spend the night with a friend . 
" But Jerry did not know any of that because he had forgotten his anniversary and decided to go out with friends and left a message . Of course , out with friends meant drinking . And drinking meant too much drinking . And driving home . "
" Jerry thought he made it home safely , albeit very late , stumbled in , and found a beautiful cold dinner on the table . He went to his bedroom door and found it locked . "
 `` Sheila ! Sheila honey open the door '' . 
 `` Go away Jerry '' . 
 `` Sheila c'mon dear lem me in '' . 
 Silence . 
" Jerry stumbled to the couch , lay down , and passed out . "
 He awoke . Bright lights . Headache . Sheila . 
" It all came back to him and now he remembered yesterday was his anniversary . Of course , Sheila had informed him of that as well in no uncertain terms . "
 He looked bleary eyed at his watch . He was going to be late again . 
" `` Sheila , I 'm sorry and I promise I will make this up to you , but I need to clean up and go to work . '' "
" She was still ranting at him , deservedly . He showered , shaved , got dressed , apologized again and left the house . "
" To see his beautiful car that he got after his promotion to Architect . His beautiful car with a smashed in headlight and front bumper crumpled . It looked driveable , so he took off . "
 `` Late late late late late '' . 
 Speeding ticket . 
 `` Really late really late really late '' . 
 Jerry H. Vah snuck into his office and logged into his system . Message from the Big Boss . `` See me when you get in '' . 
 The meeting with the Big Boss did not go well . . Management was not at all happy with the Saurian life forms on the dominant planet . He was told to get rid of them or have the project re-assigned . He was also on `` probation '' due to some incident last night involving another staff member . Louie was a jerk and always was messing with Jerry . Evidently Jerry had had enough and ... it was a bit of a blur ... but Louie ended up filing a formal complaint . 
" He got back to his desk and mumbled to himself . `` Do n't like Saurians , do they ? What do they know ? I think they 're awesome . Whatever . '' "
 He chose the SMITE command and chose the `` meteor '' option . The Saurians were no more . 
" `` Let 's see how they feel about apes . '' and got to coding .
`` What a view . You did n't have to do this , you know . I could have had a blank wall in front of me , and just thought my way through the past week . You know , moving pictures . Are you doing okay ? You cried so much after my celebration . I think more people should celebrate death . I lived a full life . All my friends were there - the ones that were left , anyhow . And you were there . The kids . You need to leave , now . I wo n't let you see me go . Kiss me , my love , and make your way . I love you . '' ( 99 words )
The station was near empty this time of night . The cold grey fog had swept into the corridors turning the lights into hazy yellow clouds . It was perfect , after weeks of scouting the stations on the J line I had found a time when the trains still ran , but had minimal people . As I come up to the end of the platform I glance down . The distance to the rail seemed much higher than I had remembered . Not that it would matter soon . I check the sign . 10 minutes . "
" The wait is agony . I pace back and forth scuffing my shoes against the yellow raised dots marking the drop into the train rails . The recessed dark metal and stone that would likely be very close , very soon . Maybe if I were blind I could have just pretended I did n't notice these and- "
 Tak . Tak . 
" Someones here ? I turn . A pale woman with pitch black hair and heels emerges from the fog . Her chiffon mermaid dress bounces as each stiletto marches closer towards me . The scarlet of her lips stand out against her lovely skin . The look on her face , all-knowing and poised . I 've never seen a more beautiful woman in my life . "
" We stand face to face , and I ca n't help but stare into her eyes . She 's not saying anything , nothing at all , but it 's as if we had been speaking the entire time . The feeling of familiarity and safety draws me closer and closer . I stare and stare , my eyes drawn to every portion of her frame . She stares back with confusion at first , then understanding . After what felt like an eternity she brings her hand to her face , and coyly drags a finger against those scarlet lips . I swallow . "
" A low rumble starts in the distance followed by a whistle . Its the train . I came all this way , all this time but I just could n't turn away . "
 `` You 're ... Beautiful . '' 
" The woman smiles , and walks towards me , crowding the space around me . My heart races , and I make no move to stop her , close enough that I can feel the cold off of her skin . She makes a spinning motion with her hands . Must mean ... "
" Icy hands brush up my back . The feeling of her fingers and palms tracing up my back makes me shudder . The train approaches swiftly , growing larger and closer by the second . For a moment I think she 's holding onto me . Clinging onto my torso . "
 `` I have never met someone who looked at me the way you do . You 've made an old woman very happy . '' She whispers into my ear . 
 `` Who are you ? '' I ask placing a hand on her wrist . 
 `` The one you 've been waiting for . '' 
" Before I can respond she withdraws her embrace and suddenly her hands are against my back . With a gentle nudge , I 'm pushed off the edge . "

 Welp looks like I missed the first part of the prompt . And here I thought I was already fudging it .

This was it . The only man who could stand in my way had agreed to face me in single combat . Legend said that none could defeat him . Legend was wrong . "
" There were older stories , from before his time . From before he was called a god on Earth . They told of a lost weapon , a sword that could strike down any foe , even one as powerful as he . And I had found it . "
 We stood across from one another in the space between the two armies . This was my chance to show them he was n't a god . This was my chance to be a hero . This was my chance to rule . 
" `` I give you one last chance to turn away , lest the gods forsake you . I am the Immortal Champion , their will incarnate . Do you really think you can stand against me ? '' "
" I shifted my grip on the sword . I smiled , and my response was a single word : "
" `` Yes . ''
Thomas was never very good with gifts . He always got something that was not quite what you wanted or not very thought through . At least he knew it and often included a receipt . "
" The first Christmas we had as co-workers and office neighbors , three years ago , Thomas got me a skateboard . I had told him that my son was a skateboarder ; he had gotten mixed up and thought I skated instead . At my birthday Thomas once bought me a camera . I have no idea why . It was a good one too . Expensive . I returned it and used the money to get him a hard drive for his PC . He had said he needed one and would n't stop thanking me for a full two weeks . "
" The gifts kept coming and they never got better , but he kept trying . And no matter what I got him he was always grateful . It made me feel bad that I could n't be as grateful in return . I knew that Thomas was always a good friend , and deserved a better friend than me . "
" So this year , after exchanging gifts once more , I sit in my office admiring Thomas 's latest attempt at gift giving : a plain mug with my name on it , in plain text . I do n't drink coffee , but I could not be happier with my present . It will remind me of him . Of the friend that he is and the person that I aspire to be like . I smile uncontrollably , staring at the mug . I could not be more grateful to Thomas .
“ Hello Angel , up for a bit of fun ? ” "
" I gritted my teeth , leaning on my scythe as I tried to keep the rage from my eyes . It didn ’ t do to antagonize him . “ No… Thanks. ” "
" Lucifer grinned , the serrated edges of his teeth gleaming in the flames . “ Ah come on , baby . You ’ ll always remember your time with the Devil. ” "
" Vile . He was vile , disgusting and depraved . I ’ d seen what he had done with the poor souls I had brought , the games he played , the deals he struck just to watch the hope burn and then die in their eyes . I raised my hood , taking in slow , deep breaths . When I got agitated , good people tended to die . The “ nice guys finish last ” clause had that effect . Another thing to bring up in my weekly meeting with God . "
" The fires of hell burned around me , my latest batch of deliveries shrieking and begging- their cries adding to the cacophony of suffering . I tried not to listen . In their screams they cursed me… Only ever me . Never the sadist responsible for their suffering . I looked up at Lucifer , freezing as I took in the hunger in his eyes . "
" “ That cloak looks good on you. ” He smirked , “ Although I know what would look better. ” "
" His hand snaked out to grab my wrist and I yanked myself away , using enough force to actually crack the bones in his fingers . He snarled , drawing back his injured hand and immediately healing his new wounds . "
" I barely had time to smirk before his power caught me , blasting me backwards and into the sulphur-covered ground , my entire body barking with pain . He took a step forward , ready to strike another blow , but at that point a halo of light surrounded me . It ’ s brightness burned him like a brand- forcing Lucifer to hop backwards , hissing . "
" “ The Big Man isn ’ t going to be around forever , Darling. ” He spat , “ And when he ’ s gone , there ’ ll be no one left to save you. ” "
" I scrambled to my feet as quickly as I could , ready to fight . The Devil just chuckled , melting into the shadows of his realm and leaving me behind , shaking . "
" As I flew out of Hell I could feel my heart pounding in synch with each beat of my blue-black wings . As much as I hated to admit it , the Devil was right . I mean , God was amazing- he took the humanitarians , the peacemakers , the freedom fighters , the saints . But what use did those souls have against the army of the Devil- the dictators , the killers , the *lawyers* ! When the final battle came , Lucifer would win . And there would be no rock left for me to hide under . "
" Above me , the humans lived out their lives . I felt the pull of a few tonight , not as many as last week . Their medicine was improving . Above me , huge cities grew and teemed with life . Even a few of those could turn the tide . "
" I knew the consequences of my choice before I made it . I knew the burden , the rights and the wrongs . I knew my punishment . "
 The decision was my own . 
" Over the next few years , close to 100 million souls were taken before their time . I wasn ’ t good at this- bringing untimely and unsanctioned ends , and I ’ m sorry to say that they likely suffered more than they had to . A small consolation is that nearly every casualty received immediate salvation- a free ticket to heaven . God ’ s ranks swelled with fighters , kings , tacticians , scientists . "
 The humans had a different name for me then- *Black Death* . 
" When Lucifer and his demons found me , as I knew they would , I was kneeling by the banks of the river Thebes . As they approached me , I could only smile . "
" It was worth it . Every cut , every scar . "
" Sometimes now , when I catch my reflection , I feel sorrow . I miss my wings- those beautiful black spans that could carry me into the heavens and the depths of the Earth . I miss my smile , my dark eyes and thick hair . "
 But then I remember ... And the regret fades away . 
" The Angel of Death was weak… But the Reaper bows to no one .
When the new girl walked into class , the teacher smiled and gave her the warm greeting she gave everyone . At the end of the standard speech she asked when Jessica 's birthday would be . "
 `` It 's on the 25th ma'am . '' 
 `` Of this month ? '' 
" `` That 's next week then ! How delightful . That 's also Tom 's birthday , so we 'll have a class party for the both of you ! Wo n't that be delightful ? '' Jessica nodded . "
 She sat next to me at lunch . `` So you 're the kid who has the same birthday right ? '' 
 `` Yup . Are you gon na be turning 9 ? '' 
 `` Yeah ! You too ? '' 
 `` Yes . It 's kind of nice to have another member of the short end club . '' 
 Her brow wrinkled . `` Short end club ? '' 
" `` As in short end of the stick . Ya know , because of the day we were born ? '' "
 `` I do n't follow you . '' 
 `` You know about how people are born with magic powers right ? Most of em are really weak though . '' 
" `` Yeah , unless they 're born the day after a massive upheaval or something . So ? '' "
" `` Well , you know what happened the day we were born right ? '' "
" `` Uh uh , what ? '' "
 `` You never heard about the Mid East Massacre ? The ISIS attack on Israel that turned the whole world against them ? '' 
 She scrunched up her face . `` I think I saw something about it on a documentary from the Discovery Channel or The New History Channel . It was like a big war that started like ... a long time ago . '' 
 `` 15 years . But the big turning point was about 9 years ago like I said . They wiped out almost an entire country in one day . The very same day you and me were born . '' 
 `` So how 's that make us ... '' her brow wrinkled again . `` Wait ... you 're sayin ' if we 'd been born a day later ... '' 
" `` We 'd be among the most powerful Wizards and Witches the world has ever seen . We 'd be at that government school in Westchester New York , or maybe even sent across the ocean as exchange to that one in Scotland that 's always in the news . We 'd be powerful and rich and famous someday . Instead , we got , y'know , the short end of the stick . '' "
" `` Well , that 's true I guess . But we could have ended up in a lot of places . Like the one in Los Angeles , or Miami , or Madrid . At the very least we 'd probably never have met and we would n't be talking right now . '' She smiled at him . Tom 's heart fluttered for a moment and he smiled too .
I had about 5 seconds to get used to lying on my back and frankly I was comfortable there until the 6th second rolled around and someone kicked me in the gut . You know what that feels like ? A good solid kick in the gut that wakes you right up and rearranges your priorities in a hurry starting with `` make that not happen again , please '' . "
" So I was pretty pissed when I opened my eyes , breath gathered ready to swear the first person I saw into oblivion . That it was me made me pause halfway through `` Sonovvua- '' "
 It was me . 
 I 'd kicked me . 
" Or at least me with breasts , muscles and glasses , none of which I remembered having . I put my face in my hands , rubbed my eyes with my palms and opened them again to see , yup . Lady Me . Me'Lady in fact . There could be no question . "
 `` Uh '' I said like the eloquent conversationalist I am . 
" And she responded with , in my voice but falsetto , `` Shut up . I know you have questions . Frankly we all do . But if you 're anything like the others you 'll wait like we 've been waiting too . '' "
 This did n't help . So instead I edged myself onto my elbows and looked around . Me and Me'lady were in a bright white walled room with one transparent wall that looked onto a corridor with other such rooms . 
 She 'd planted herself ( myself ? ) against the opposite wall and it took me a few more seconds before my head was clear enough for words . 
" When I did , it was , `` Hello '' because you 've got to start with hello . "
" Or not , because she did n't reciprocate . "
" So instead I asked , `` So ... .there 's a lot of those eh ? '' "
" `` Those ? `` , she raised an eyebrow and it looked just like I 'd always thought I looked like when I did that . "
 `` The rooms with ... .us ... in them '' 
 `` Yup . Listen do you remember anything ? '' 
" I could n't . And I had a feeling she was expecting that to be the answer . So instead I asked her , `` Does any of us ? Also , why did you kick me ? If you broke a kidney and I need a replacement I know I 'm taking one of yours . '' "
" `` Pipe down smartass . And no , none of us remember . There 's a girl 3 rooms down who says he 's been here for an hour . No one across from him knows morse so we do n't know how many of ... us there are . And I kicked you because the alternative was listening to you snore and these rooms are soundproof . You know that by the way ? You snore ? '' That voice , it was mine but different . Like if I 'd pinched my throat and done an impression of a lady . Like that , but ... natural . Real . And lovely . Apparently I loved hearing the sound of my own voice . "
 Suffice to say that presented more questions than it answered and I 'd only just thought of the first I was going to ask when a voice boomed through the room and we both looked up at the perforated surface of a white painted speaker on the wall . 
" `` ATTENTIO- ! Oh , sorry about that , is it low ? I lowered the volume , it should be okay now . Anyways . Hi ! I am Cid . Yes , yes I know , we 're ALL Cid , it 's very droll but I 'm Cid the original . Cid in fact , of this universe . Which none of you in fact are . of this universe that is . I 'm really really sorry about that but uh , apparently , there are side effects that we were n't really ready for , and after the first dozen of ... .us , uh , we , just kept coming and coming . We did n't even have a place to store and categorize all of you until a few hours ago . Sorry about the rooms by the way , it was all we had until we could sort this whole mess out . "
 Hm . 
" Speaking of which , I guess I should tell you all , me ? Us . I should tell all of us that this is , technically , and I can not stress this enough , ACCIDENTALLY , my fault . Ish . Sort of . Look I 'm just saying no one could have seen this . Like no one could have predicted this would happen . We just turned it on for a few minutes and then you , I , we started just streaming through like it was a house party . And then we could n't turn it off and on again because it would n't turn off and we do n't know why it 's still on except we ca n't turn it off . You see , one of us , across multiple dimensions , mine in fact , the one you 're all ... we 're all in now was a scientist at CERN . Me in fact . Working on the ol ' LHC . That 's the
“ Shit , there goes another one. ” General Turr mumbled to , Taek , his first officer , “ They ’ re getting a lot more accurate , they used to miss by a few thousand kilometres. ” "
" Turning the ship towards the newly arrived HomoSapien space liner , the Exerprise H56 , the Kantian war ship set about tracking the liner and getting all of its clearances and passes checked . "
" “ Yeah , but they are still missing the safe zones . If it weren ’ t for the jelly shields of the Salec ’ s their FTL travel would ’ ve been banned. ” "
" The liner is easily one of the smallest ships currently docked at the way spacion , the HomoSapiens had only discovered their FTL travel 20 years ago . The Kantian ’ s , Salec ’ s , Maltuin ’ s and Delfanit ’ s were shocked , never thinking that a species with only two arms could create such technology . "
" “ It ’ s Unorthodox , Unsafe and Damn Stupid ! It UUDS ! ” The council meetings had been plagued with these words for ages . "
" Taek , going through each clearance code with a meticulousness that only he could , motions to the debris trail left behind the liners “ If we shared our technology with them , they could travel through the gates. ” "
 “ It would also decrease the bloody clean-up required each time. ” 
" “ You know we can ’ t , the treaty stands and the human ships aren ’ t dense enough to handle the radiation. ” The general replies , not mentioning that the few ships that have tried it crashed into each other . "
" “ How , exactly do they even travel this far anyway ? It would seem that their ships and bodies wouldn ’ t be able to handle the forces. ” Taek asks for the millionth time . "
" “ Well , they have this theory of relativity , which says the faster you travel the more mass you have . It overcomplicated all of their scientific endeavours. ” The general begins , earning a collective moan from everyone awake in the warships control room . "
" “ So when they started travelling at close to light speed they just assumed that they couldn ’ t travel as fast or faster . They built engines that can get to 80 % the speed of light , which is something our ships do with impulse engines. ” "
" “ That only took them to the edge of their own solar system , something admirable but it still confined them to their own corner . The Salec wave riders were considering helping them to travel faster , however , about 21 years ago when they sent a probe ship , they found rings the size of moons being placed on the edges of their solar system. ” He pauses to ensure that Taek is still listening , which of course he is . "
" “ Curious the Salec ’ s stood back and watched . The humans had somehow discovered how to warp space but only between two set places . Their warp drives also temporarily increased their speed to 3 FTL , which they still haven ’ t entirely realised. ” "
" This next bit is where the council is still struggling to accept the HomoSapiens as a race , the council usually worked well together on making decisions , but dangerous travel that still worked was a grey area . Every other race were too cautious to attempt something unkown . "
" “ Well , to start traversing through space , the humans would travel from their home planet at the maximum speed they can travel . Aiming straight for the warp gates , at first , but eventually at different angles . This caused them to easily travel to new solar systems . It also made it difficult for them to actually stop. ” "
" “ Which is why their first three ships flew straight into , in order or severity , the council war fleet , the council ’ s moon of operations and the dwarf star of the Antraci system . Total count of death combined was well over 100-million. ” "
 “ Of course after catching the attention of the council and several other alien races the HomoSapiens eventually made contact with us and we were able to stop their exploration ships before more damage could be caused . The thing that surprised most races was that after three failed attempts the humans were still attempting FTL travel. ” 
" “ It wasn ’ t until first contact that the Salec ’ s realised that humans were still using Radio waves to communicate across vast distances . But , that advancement in their tech is a whole different story and involves several strange messages that either offended everyone or caused peace treaties to be made with the Andromeda Galaxy. ” "

You would n't think that a jolly fat man who brings presents to little boys and girls would have so many enemies but he does . There are a ton of politics that go into being Santa , and for the past 10 years I 've been his `` repair man '' . I helping fix any problems that may arise . Labor disputes between elves , reindeer suppliers wanting to back out . Originally it was easy for the big man to deliver joy to all the little boys and girls of the earth but that was back when A piece of fruit and a wooden car would put a smile on their face . Then along came things like Hasbro , Lego , Barbie then those were all that kids wanted . These things aint cheap . So Santa had to start doing the one thing he could think of to make ends meet , drug trafficking . I mean no one could beat `` around the world in one night '' . <newline> I guess he got lucky with me . You see I was never the smartest guy . I dropped out of high school and spent the next six years trying to make ends meet however I could . One night I got desperate . I was going to sell my soul to the devil in order to get what I wanted . I had everything set up , candles , pigs blood , the whole nine yards . Except one small thing , I wrote Santa instead of Satan , I mean looked right to me but must have been my dyslexia . And so here I am , the assassin for a jolly fat man .
When I was a young boy , my father and I went into the city on a cold winter day . He told me never to go to the city alone , but that it was important I see what happened there . "
" <newline> As we entered through a large , ornate blackend iron gate , I began to ask how that could happen to metal but hushed me and told me not to speak until he spoke to me . I nodded meakly and we continued into the city . "
 
" There were scores of people lining the streets , but no one made a sound . The silence in a city so large was eerie at best . Even as a child I knew something was wrong . Once again I began to ask my father our purpose but he shushed me once more . Then I heard it . "
 
" From what seemed like a great distance , music began to play . But not any kind of music I had heard before . It grew in volume exponentially fast , covering what seemed like miles in mere moments . Then they turned onto the street we were standing to the side of . "
" <newline> What I saw would later be explained to me as the black parade . It was led by a marching band , but something was wrong with their instruments . Every chord and note seemd sour somehow . Behind them were scores of soldiers , all armed to the teeth and dressed in black combat gear . Once they had passed my father and I swiftly left the city . "
 
" Once we got home , he told me about the black parade and why it existed . There were things in this world which needed to be contained and controlled . He said that because I was his first born son , that one day when I was older I would need to become a savior , someone who could bring salvation to those who were broken and dammed . That I would join the Black Parade . Today is day 421 of my march , and the music plays on . <newline>

 `` Keeping the party going ? '' 
" `` Nah , nah , nah . Just got up . You know . Going out tomorrow . Just being prepared . '' I lied , bouncing from foot to foot . I felt the 6 baggies hit my palm as he slapped me five . "
" `` You gon na be real ... '' My back was already to him as I scurried down the sidewalk . `` Save me the fucking sales pitch '' I think to myself , knowing I 'll be calling him again in an hour ... sweating , shaking , hating myself . "
" The fuck is wrong with me ? Like I ai n't ever seen a movie before . Old Chinese dude in a dusty shop . Yeah , this shit always ends well ... riiiiiight . Makes perfect sense too . Old Chinese dude . Chinese antiques . Chinese spices . Chinese art . Oh , and Merlin 's Coin . Merfuckinlin 's Coin he tells me . $ 308.80 a day until I 'm financially secure . $ 308.80 a day until I burn my lips off on this fucking crack stem is more like it . "
" Oh , I had high hopes . High hopes I did . Gon na get out of debt . Gon na get caught up on my rent . Gon na make something of myself . Gon na smoke that $ 308.80 right the fuck up . That 's what I 'm gon na do . That 's what I did . That 's what I 've been doing for the past 8 months . "
" The plywood was hardly back in place before I was pulling out my piece and loading it up with a fresh whack . Pop , pop , sizzle , and I 'm out . Tingly . Warm . Fuck that Chinese motherfucker and his fucking King Arthur coin of the fucking round table bullshit . The lighter flares up , I inhale , hold it . "
" `` $ 308.80 a day to turn my life around . Ai n't that some shit ? ''
The village was always peaceful at night . The sun setting in the ash-gray sky mixed with the twinkle of the light-drones floating by set a happy mood that contrasted with the way we were all feeling . Many of us would leave this very night . Not many of us would come back . "
" I held my daughter 's hand for what might be the last time ever , the twin red ribbons on my head snapping lightly in the breeze . The rest of the men were gathered in the center of the town , waiting for instructions to come in on the once-new projector mounted on the town hall . The Alliance would be sending missives tonight , ordering the troops out across the frontier once again . "
" This war was breaking apart families once again . I never thought it would be me dying out there until I saw the blood red envelope waiting for me outside my door a few months ago . Red is the color of the elite troops in the Alliance 's so-called Glorious Army . Many say they used to have white ribbons , but they were covered with so much blood that they decided to keep that color . "
" With the rifle issued to me heavy on my back , I squatted and picked up my daughter . Her name was Dawn , and she was the reason I was going with the elite guard . I was fighting for her freedom , my wife 's freedom , the village 's freedom . The resources being fought over mattered little to me . "
" I kissed Dawn on the forehead , then took her over to her mother . I put her gently into my wife 's arms , and then looked at my wife . There were tears in both of our eyes . Before turning away , I stroked my daughter 's ribbons and hair one last time , and then turned away from them . The screen had come to life , and a grizzled general was issuing orders to the troops across the nation . "
" There was a saying among the elite guard . Those who fight for their country would die for it , and those that fought for themselves might survive . It was a dishonest , horrible practice , but the self-preservation that most of the soldiers had in mind was the only way that they could survive . I had sworn to never be like those men . "
" I would fight and die for my country , my town , my family . My life might be taken , but for their sake , I will freely give it up . I had sworn to be a good man , but at that moment , I remembered what the other men had said to me in training . "
" The good die young .
I stare at the phone skeptically as it continues to ring . After the third ring , I answer . Hello ? who is this ? `` Hello , Mr. Ross . It 's good to hear you found it , and right on time , it seems '' . What ? How do you know me ? When did you put this phone here ? *looks around* ... .Where are you ? `` Why do you ask ? Are you concerned that I might be hidden somewhere nearby ? I can assure you , I 'm not . But if you 're really that worried I 'll give you some time to search the area and collect your thoughts . I 'll call you back in exactly fifteen minutes '' . ... ... ... ..He hung up ... . No number in the caller ID either ... "
" I look around again . I 'm in a small clearing , in a wooded area , about two miles from the road , on private property . At an old campsite I used to use when I was a kid . There 's no trace of anyone . It 's mid autumn , so the ground is strewn with fallen leaves . The plot where my time capsule was supposed to be appeared untouched before I started digging . Mostly covered with leaves , a little grass . How did he know when to call ? "
 I spend about ten minutes exploring the area in search of a camera . First I look for any incoming wires that I might 've missed on my way in . nothing . maybe it 's wireless and there 's a transmitter nearby ? That might explain why the phone has signal here . Or maybe a motion sensor in the phone triggered the call . Who would do something like this ? 
" Is it a prank ? I did n't tell anyone I was coming . Hell , until this morning I did n't Know I was coming here . So how would anyone else ? *riiing* *riiing* . Hello ? `` Time 's up Mr Ross . Did you find anything '' . Not a thing . What do you want ? `` My my , impatient are n't you ? Perhaps we should get to know one another first . '' Sure thing , just tell me where you are and we 'll have a nice long chat . `` Very well . Meet me at your favorite caffe . You know the one '' . *Click* . What caffe ? I have n't been to a caffe in ... . how could he even know that ? I 've never told anyone . "
" ( I 've never really written anything before , so if this sucks , I 'm genuinely sorry . I know the story seems vague so far but I have some interesting plot points in mind ... I just do n't know how to add them without extending the story ... and being that I 'm not a writer at all ... .. this is hard ... .But if anyone happens to like it I can keep going )
Samson stood up out of his car and stretched out as he shut the door behind him . It was n't a long drive to get there , but with the sun 's rays warming him in the brisk morning , he could n't help but stretch and bask in it a little . This was the kind of morning Wanda would go out in a swimsuit and get some basking in herself if she were awake at this hour . Samson figured maybe if he hurried he could get back in time before she woke up , maybe suggest it was a good day for basking , 14 years of marriage and he was still excited to just glimpse her in a bathing suit . <newline> If the thoughts of seeing his wife did n't hurry Samson up to the front doors of the building , the putrid odor from the cigarettes the guards outside the doors were holding sure did . Samson , who was usually a very open minded man about people vices , glowered at the guards who for the most part ignored him as they seemed to be inhaling as much as they could through their sickly white straws . <newline> When he got through the doors though , he had a bit more empathy for the guards , he surely would have turned to something unpleasant to help him deal with this place . It was n't a gross place , or even disorganized , in fact it was quite the opposite . Such a clean sterile , environment should n't have such a negative aura , but this place did . A man coughed to Samson 's left , obviously to get his attention . <newline> “ Mr . Baker , the man inquired ? ” <newline> Samson , took off his his beanie and turned to face the shorter and much plumper man before him . “ No sir , Samson , sir . I 'm covering for Neville today. ” <newline> “ I do n't blame the man for missing an appointment with Jack , it 's all routine anyway , nothing ever changes , come come though , no need to let this place creep in on you longer than it needs to. ” The man turned surprisingly fast for his plumpness and led him down into a long hallway lined by doors , the whole time talking to him and fiddling with the keys . “ I do n't suppose Neville has told you anything about this mans story has he , I suppose it will be good to get a fresh perspective ” , he said not waiting for an answer . <newline> “ Here we are Mr. Samson , see if you can get him to give up his angel. ” The plump man opened the door and gave Samson a grin and a wink as he gestured him in . Samson , determined not to be unnerved , stepped through the door calmly and professionally , barely flinching as the door closed and locked behind him . <newline> The place Samson found himself in was even more at odds with it 's looks and its feel than the entrance was . It was homely , almost welcoming , but the feeling of the room carried a distinctive haze . In fact it reminded him of the one time he had tried refer , calm and relaxed but out of it . <newline> A man sat up on his bed and beamed a huge smile at Samson , who was taken aback by the warmness of the man who must be Jack . <newline> “ Come on in sir , I 've been expecting you , ca n't say I 'd have thought you would have come so soon , but I can not complain about such haste , as it can only be to my benefit . You may have a seat right here and I shall sit across from you ” , Jack spat out hurriedly as he gathered chairs and sat them across from each other . <newline> “ Thank you Jack , I did not think you 'd be expecting me , how did you know I would be here today ? ” Samson sat down as uneasily as his question came out . Jack was not at all what he expected , but for a man who was touched by an angel , his cheeriness did make sense . <newline> “ Well , you can come sooner , or you can come later , but you will come , so I will be expecting you to come , it all makes sense. ” <newline> Samson was not quite sure as to the logic behind that , but he did n't feel the need to press Jack on it . “ If you do n't mind , I am going to begin right away. ” The plump man was right , Samson did not need to be here any longer than he had to . He pulled up his briefcase and reviewed some files inside , after getting a good read on what was written he pulled out his badge and handed it to Jack . “ This is to assure you I am here on good intentions , the law protects you , you do n't have to give up anything you do n't want to , and you will be safe here with me. ” <newline> Jack instantly pushed the badge back into Samson 's hand after Samson pulled it out . “ I have faith sir , I do n't need proof , I know why you are here. ” <newline> “ Let 's make this fast then , where did you first see this guardian angel ? ” Samson took out a pencil and paper for his own notes , and a tape recorder to get the transcript of
Growing up in the city with two brothers , I valued being alone from a very young age . I often used to ( and sometimes still do ) dream of being the only child . Not because I wouldn ’ t have to share or because Mom would spoil me a little more . I just wanted to be alone . I think that ’ s why the week with Grandpa each summer meant so much to me . It wasn ’ t that I didn ’ t or don ’ t love my family , it ’ s that I wanted to know what it was to be me . "
" Grandpa understood being alone . I hadn ’ t known my Grandma . Well at least I didn ’ t remember . There some pictures of her and I – me in a diaper and her holding a cocktail - but they could have been any other baby and I wouldn ’ t have know any better . Grandpa never talked about her and I ’ m not sure that he really missed her . By all accounts they had been very much in love , but Grandpa was a pragmatist and never seemed to dwell on things . "
" Mostly during that week each summer , Grandpa would leave me alone . I ’ d explore the channel behind his house or dig through the barn looking for forgotten treasure . When I was a little older , I ’ d read a GooseBump or spend the whole day watching TV . Grandpa didn ’ t much care what I did . "
 Grandpa – like all adults in my mind – was concerned about things that were neither important nor interesting . He did a lot of rummaging . Seemed to need to go on boring shopping trips all the time . Spent a lot of time with the newspaper . I never gave any of these things any thought . 
" Occasionally I would have to do some chore . Painting a railing , cleaning an attic or some other project that needed to be done , but really didn ’ t need to be done . These generally lasted less than a day and were more for the sake of him being able to tell my mom how he had whipped me in to shape more than anything else . We were in the same space , but weren ’ t sharing the same time . "
 The summer I turned 14 was the first summer I remember not wanting to go to Grandpa 's . I had been allowed some small freedoms at home and the allure of being alone with my Grandpa for a week evaporated quickly . I didn ’ t need this anymore now that I finally had my own room and was allowed to stay out till 7 . Plus my girlfriend who I was madly in love with was definitely going to dump me if I didn ’ t see her for a week . 
" On top of all that it rained all week . I did what any 14 year old stuck in a house for a week effectively without an adult would do . Lots of tv . Lots of computer games . Lots of texting . Lots of masturbating . Grandpa didn ’ t bother me outside of breakfast and dinner . Even then we barely spoke . He asked me about school and girls , but I gave him the same canned responses I gave to every adult . I don ’ t think I asked him anything . "
" The week passed uneventfully as it always had . On Thursday , Grandpa let me know that the chore for this week would be organizing the basement while he went to whatever the VA was . "
" “ Now when you ’ re down there make sure to sweep and clean up as much crap as you can , but don ’ t go lookin where you don ’ t need to ” "
" Like all adults Grandpa was so easy to ridicule . “ How will I know what I do or do not need ? ” , I replied in a voice that only 14 year old boys who think they are smarter than god can muster . "
" He stared at me for a couple of seconds before sternly saying , “ Don ’ t open the box that say ‘ bones ’ on it. ” "
" “ Oh , Okay Grandpa. ” How old did he think I was ? Like he would really be storing bones in the basement . "
 We didn ’ t say anything else . He finished and left . I watched some TV and texted my girlfriend about watching out for bones in the basement . Eventually I sauntered downstairs . 
" The basement was surprisingly empty . A little dust , but really there wasn ’ t much to do . As I swept , I absentmindedly scanned the boxes in front of me smiling thinking about the box of bones and my Grandpa the serial killer . At some point I realized that I had stopped sweeping and found myself staring at a cardboard box . Neatly written on the side “ Bones – Stay Out. ” "
 I braced myself . What the actual hell man ? I picked up the box carefully . It didn ’ t rattle . It didn ’ t smell like the dead rats in the garage . It was heavy . Whatever was inside shifted slightly . The box looked and felt like a moving box . A normal cardboard box . That didn ’ t stop me from shaking . 
" I slowly pulled back the lid
`` Jerry ... Jerry ! '' "
" Jerry jerked his head up , looking left then right at the millions of angels staring back at him . The podium was empty ! Coming to his senses , he felt the soft hum of a trillion tappings of tiny , bored fingertips that reverberated across the Infinity Boardroom to the end of the universe and back . "
" `` Jerry , '' God sighed patiently , `` Please . If you may . It is your turn . '' "
" `` Y-yes , '' he stammered , echoing his uncertainty across The Loudspeaker . Now biting his tongue , he galloped up to the podium , still mid-blush . Placing his palm on The Dial , screens appeared down as far as the eye can Holy See . "
" Clearing his throat , finally , he began : "
" `` Your Majesty . Winged souls . Betty ... '' — he could just make out Betty mouthing 'Oh , stop it ! ' in the distance — `` My team and I have read through His Holy Source code ... with His Divine Permission '' — God nodded in approval here — `` and it appears we had overlooked some of our Loop functions . '' Knowing nods across the Universe sent ripples through the ether , followed by a quite beautiful and harmonious 'Ohhhhh ' beginning to sound . `` Humans can in theory Loop in as many souls as they wish . Which is exactly what they are doing . Which is why a good number of you are here ... '' "
" Jerry rotated his hand on The Dial . `` If you take a look at the screeeennns ... . '' — he over-emphasized the last word — `` you 'll see our Soul quota for this era , which has been absolutely eclipsed by Humans ' ingenuity recently . For the older souls here , the red line on the bottom indicates how many Souls we should be producing ... quite flat , mostly ... and the really fat blue line on top is how many are actually being produced . You see that up-tick near the end ? "
" `` I am afraid that with their near-daily and quite honestly , exponential , advances in Artificial Intelligence , engineering , physics ... we are spelling the end of the Universe as we know it . It 's only a matter of time before **they** tap into the Source code itself ... "
" `` So my team and I are going to turn off Time Production – yes , literally stop Time – until we figure this out . Our soul output will stall for a few Biblical Days ... It 's the best we can do . '' "
" God clenched His Dial , projecting an empty image with a floating beard onto the Infinity Boardroom 's many screens . `` Hold on one moment , Jerry . I 'd like to get Satan 's input on this . This relates to his department . '' "
" There was a long silence that felt like an eternity . Sure enough , an eternity later , Satan 's face was occupying the top right corner of the screens . "
 `` Hey ! '' Satan said . 
" `` Hey , '' God said . `` Jerry is just with me right now . Jerry ? '' "
" `` Yeah , I 'm here . Satan , do you hear me ? '' "
" `` Perfectly , '' Satan said . "
" `` Great , '' Jerry continued , `` As I was saying , we ca n't have one soul going to Hell with another to Heaven . It 's defeating the whole purpose of our merit-based system . '' "
" `` Or demerit-based system , '' Satan hissed . `` As it were . '' "
" God interjected : `` Satan , do you have enough souls to operate the machinery Down There for a few Biblical Days ? We need to have a look at the Source code , so we 'll have to stop Time herself , but we do n't want to muck you up . '' "
 `` How many Biblical Days are we talking about ? '' Satan asked . 
 `` About five . '' 
" After another eternity , Satan gasped : `` Five ? '' "
 `` Yeah . Five . '' 
" `` Alright . I can make this work . Jerry , keep me updated . '' And his image flickered off the screen .
With God as my witness , I would not crack . "
" My opponent stared me down , rivaling the ferocity with which I glared into him . The room would have been silent but for the clock , whose ticks and tocks kept the rhythm of our rivalry . The world was dead to us now ; had fire broken out we would have each surely perished before accepting our loss to the other . "
" This was not to say it was easy to maintain . In his eyes I could see a madness stretched out across infinity . Those dark , unblinking corneas spun a tale of deception . If my guard went down for even a moment , all would be lost . "
" `` You ca n't win '' he said , his smug fuckin grin making me clench my fist in rage . "
" `` You just watch me '' I retorted , the strain of our contest sapping the wit from my tongue . "
" As confident as I must have sounded , the reality was much more grim . I could not say which direction our battle of wills was tilting , but barring equal exhaustion on his part I had little chance of victory . There was a fire in my eyes , a fire which I knew I could only put out with a concession of defeat . "
" No . Not now . I had come too far , sacrificed too much to be the loser . Just a little longer now . He could n't hold out forev- "
 He blinked . 
 He totally blinked .

After the set time for my waking up which I set last night at 7:00am passed , I opened my eyes to me standing up . <newline> I , however , thought nothing of it as it happens everyday . What I thought about however , is that my food meter is <newline> nearly depleted . And nobody likes it when their food meter is almost depleted . "
" So I walked , or more accurately , slid my feet down the stairs then walked straight towards the `` Winter-Chest '' . <newline> I grabbed the first food that I found that needed the least cooking skill to cook , hotdogs and some bread , threw <newline> the hotdogs into the micro-fire oven , then ate them , resulting in a nearly full food meter . "
" But due to the sound the micro-fire emits , a certain level 40 upstairs woke up then went crashing down the stairs <newline> and started blabbering about matters that I shall not list . "
" `` Yeah , Yeah . Okay I get it mom , geez . '' Is the magical incantations needed to make her stop . "
" `` Whatever , just get yourself ready for school , bus is almost arriving . '' Powerless against her , I just did what I <newline> was preparing to do in the first place . I then did the neccesities for venturing outside , then waited for the bus <newline> at the bus stop . "

" It was 7:15 on a lousy evening in Jindabyne as Sean drove along the dark , icy road . This winter had been particularly cruel to Sean ; fewer people had been staying at his lodge which forced him to cut the cleaning staff . Sean had been struggling to run the lodge and clean it . He felt he deserved some fun , something to fill him with such satisfaction and happiness . Driving along the road , he smiled . “ Where are you ? ” he muttered . As he drove around a bend , there she was . She was young , probably around 21 . Her blonde hair blew to one side in the wind . She was clinging on to her backpack and stood stiff like a post with one arm out . “ There you are. ” Sean said blissfully . There she was . Sean pulled up the fixed blade in his boot , just touching it made his heart race . He pulled to the side of the road and opened the door . “ Do ya need a lift , love ? ” He yelled over the wind . She stared at him , Sean worried he had already scared her , she ’ s so small and helpless he thought . “ I can call you a taxi but you might be waiting a while. ” With that she gathered her things and got in the front seat . They sat in silence for a while , Sean was trying to be patient , he didn ’ t want to seem too eager but he had been longing for this for quite some time . It had been almost 8 months since his last kill and 8 months wasn ’ t enough to suffice . “ You know where you ’ d like to go ? ” He pushed . She turned to him and he almost groaned when he saw her sad , grey eyes . “ I ’ m hungry. ” She stated . So am I Sean thought . “ Alright , well I can take you into town ? Get you a nice hearty meal , what do ya say ? ” Sean said in fatherly voice . The girl nodded . For the first few minutes Sean and the girl said nothing . Sean was excited , too excited . He could smell her lavender shampoo and it was driving him crazy . He kept thinking of what her name might be , how when the moment that she told him her name , he would never forget it . She was his now , no one else ’ s . “ How long will it take to get there ? ” the girl asked , interrupting Sean ’ s train of thought . “ About 35 minutes give or take ” Sean said , smiling . Make her feel safe he thought I want her to feel safe . A few more minutes passed until Sean could take no more silence . Who are you , where are you from , why are you here ? He thought . He had to know . “ I ’ m Sean by the way… ” He said , indicating a response . The girl nodded politely and looked outside the window . “ And your name is ? ” He pushed on . “ Amity ” she replied , still looking outside the window . Amity ! Oh Amity , Amity ! You will make me a happy man . “ That ’ s a beautiful name , Amity. ” She turned her head and smiled wryly “ I ’ ve always hated it actually . I plan to change my name one day ” she said as she began to play with her bracelet . “ What would you change it to then ? ” Sean asked , almost in flirtatiously . “ Jane ” she said with a pause . “ Plain Jane , that ’ s the name for me ” she said sweetly . I love you Sean thought . How can I love you , if I want to kill you ? “ Well , I like either of them . They both suit you ” Sean replied , now feeling uneasy about what the night held for him . What was happening to him ? How could he even feel like this ? I will go through with this , it ’ s what I want , it ’ s what I need ! He told himself . He began to struggle to find himself , he looked at his watch , ten minutes had passed , and he needed to get going if he wanted this to happen . Just before he went to ask her a question she got a flask out of her backpack . She looked at him and smiled . “ I ’ m not a big drinker but I find this warms me up. ” She went to take a swig but then paused “ Sorry , I ’ m so rude . Would you like some ? ” She said her eyes still so sad . I love you , I love you , I love you ! Sean sang to himself . Maybe a drink will help ? I have to go through with this ! “ Sure , why not ? ” Sean said shrugging casually . He took three decent gulps and handed it back . “ Bottoms up ” She said , smiling at him in such a way that made him feel sick . Sean took a road taking them further from town , unbeknownst to Amity . Not long now my sweet Amity , I
In the blink of an eye , it was gone . The muffled sirens , the awkward discomfort in her chest – in the end there had n't been time for pain . The worst part had been the anticipation , and even that had come and gone before she 'd had time to breathe . All she could do was watch , instinctively raising her arms in front of her face as the debris flew towards her . "
 *Where was ... where am I ? * 
" She tried to open her eyes , but the world flooded her vision with blinding light , forcing her to squeeze her eyelids closed and shiver in darkness . The liquid surrounding her was cold , and she felt the stiff goosebumps rising on every patch of her naked body . Her ears rang with the sound of nothing in particular . She felt an emptiness inside her . "
 *An ... Anna . That 's right . That 's ... me ? * 
" She could n't recall asking herself any questions , but the answers were there . As more details trickled into the forefront of her mind , she began to piece together still images of a bar . Or was it a restaurant ? "
 *Who is he ? * 
" Her mind fumbled , searching for a memory to pivot on . She did n't know why she was drawn to him . The motionless images came one after the other , but his face remained a blur . "
 *Centaur Cafe . That 's right ... I had a ... a ... box ? * 
" Anna was beginning to feel a pressure in her forehead , as if someone was pumping air into her skull . "
 *Such a tiny box ... * 
" She opened her eyes again , squinting against the bright lights surrounding her . Everything seemed to be white , with the exception of the shadowy silhouettes in the distance . Anna could see just enough to know they must be people . "
 *Lee ... Leah ? No ... * 
 One of the silhouettes moved around more than the others . Something about the movements seemed agitated . 
" *Li ... Liam ? Ah , yes , sounds so familiar ... * "
" She felt a surge of warmth fill her chest . Something about finding the name – thinking it , even – breathed life into her . "
 *Liam ! * 
" Memories swirled through Anna 's mind , rapidly producing images of his goofy smile and the feelings of butterflies filling her stomach . "
" *Of course , the box ... that was the night he ... * "
" Anna remembered the ring . Liam had been so nervous , he 'd dropped the ring into a piece of cheesecake . Anna giggled to herself . Her laughter came out as gurgles , and her memories retreated . She felt an uncomfortable twitch in her back . "
 *Where am I ? * 
" An image popped into her head – something moving unnaturally fast . Her shoulders tensed , bracing for impact . "
 *That ... was ... that hit me . It must have hit me . * 
" Suddenly , Anna realized where she was . She remembered the meeting with the insurance company , she remembered being on the fence about the ridiculous price tag , and she even remembered the pamphlet . *The Future of Life Insurance* , that 's what it had said . Anna squinted again as she scanned her body , noticing the thin tubes attached to various parts of her body . "
" *Only this is n't my body . It 's an ... empty shelf , a copy . A clone . My Clone ... * "
" Anna tried to remember what had happened to Liam . She had n't seen him getting struck by the debris , but they had been sitting so close . Their hands had been touching . Anna 's back began to hurt , as if something was twisting her spine . She felt her legs , but her toes seemed to have gone numb . She could see more clearly now , and the silhouettes were unmistakably human . Many of the people were surrounding the agitated person , and a few had their arms moving , in what appeared to be explanatory gestures . "
" Anna 's back twitched again , and she looked down to her feet . Her vision was pretty clear at this point , and she saw her knees and toes floating . She tried to stretch her toes , but they did n't move . She tried bending her knees . They did n't budge . "
" The agitated person pushed past the other people , who shook their heads in disapproval but did nothing more to intervene . Anna watched with curiosity as the figure approached . A few seconds later , she could tell the figure was a man . He was not fully clothed . "
 *Liam ! Is it you ? * Anna gurgled softly in the water as her mouth lazily traced the words . 
" His face had a few more lines on it than her memory had shown , but that was back when he 'd proposed , years before they had even thought about buying into their insurance policy . "
" Liam pressed his hand against the containment glass , peering in at her . His lips were moving , but no sound made it through the barrier . She tried to point her finger to her ear , but her arm was not yet that
I thought it would be colder , overall . "
" When my body was being prepped and I signed the mandatory liability claims , which I felt were more of a bureaucratic formality , oh how I wish I took that 10-day legal studies master course in Khan VR . My very nerves were glazed instantly with a thick preserving frost with its usual instant numbness , but something was off , I remembered the warning now : All Neural implants must be declared before service . I felt everything shut down except my tinnitus , a usually tolerable aftereffect of my subpar self-surgery . "
 `` Fuck '' echoed through my very empty mind . 
" When I decided to be an investigative journalist , examining the wrong doings of conglomerates that control entire asteroid mining expeditions and star-skimming operations , I felt that I was smart enough to know how to make a difference without being a martyr . Having illegally and home brew connected neural enhancers and occipital lobe 'plants tied to my eyes was one of my ways to get a highclass admin position at Orion-Noko Production Enterprises without getting flagged as a corporate espionage agent , or worse a freelance reporter with a high sense of ethics . "
" What I was lacking , was the actual experience with cryo-interaction with deep cognition implants . Luckily , 8 years in my own head without any sense except for thought has at least gave me time to manually reconstruct several lessons of nano-computing physics and bio-connections . What it has n't done , was keep me from making over 6 million different plans to crucify the O.N Enterprises CEO 's scrotum on live feed . The one where I learn to terraform an asteroid into a large space golem that punches through that fucker 's personal earth orbiting satellite island is my favourite . Though , what it helped me do is learn about the human machine , I knew my philosophy courses would play out one day . "
" I could keep track of time through an internal clock , my neural works allow me to multitask cognitively , which most people without an implant will find a cognitive impossibility to actually think of two things at once , which is a life saver since I can keep time running . I knew the approximate time of our cryo-trip was 8-years , 3-years manual observation of the mineral harvest and some self-experimentation for those interested in the extra-credit . I 'm a person known for thinking things through , as I am doing so in the 49.5 miliseconds as I can literally feel my body being unfrozen , the blackness only filled with my own mental illusions lifted and my first words being uttered , "
 `` That was a nice 5 minutes of sleeping upwards . Got any cheese ? '' 
" I 'm going to break this conglomerate apart and show the world and suffer another 8 years in my circus of a subconscious if I need to do it . <newline>
The storm came on slowly , looming ominously throughout the day until the fading light vanished beyond the horizon , and with it , peace . The winds howled furiously , the trees ' branches shaking violently , the weaker ones snapping off . Then the black clouds unleashed the might of their rain The torrent drowned out all other sound . Only the terrible crack of thunder rose above the din , thrumming with deadly ominousness . Dust turns to mud , roads into rivers . Animals are driven inside with frantic energy as their minders urge them onward . Elsewhere , others race about in urgency as well . "
" Up on the cliffs overlooking the port , the castle is awake in the storm . Staff enlist the aid of the palace guards , sending them to and fro bearing buckets as they struggle to prevent the leaks from damaging the castle . Throughout the castle can be heard the *Drip , drip , drip* of tin buckets and wooden pail as they rapidly fill up . The housekeeper directs battle-hardened soldiers as they race to keep the storm from ruining any of the priceless items within the palace . "
" Perched up on the banister overlooking the great hall is Sir Lawrence , garbed in his cloak of office and badge of rank . Leaning against a tall marble column , he lets one of his booted feet dangle freely in the air , tapping absently to the sound of the nearest filling bucket . His eyeless sockets stare out emptily over the teem mass of servants and guards , taking in the scene like twin black holes . A skeletal hand is hitched on his sword belt , the leather well worn and oiled . The other scratches at a beard that has n't existed for a hundred years . "
" Thunder roars . Then lightning strikes the castle , blinding the castle 's staff and Lawrence 's soldiers in a feverish light . Several cry aloud at painful brightness before it abruptly vanishes into lingering nothingness . <newline> Slowly , the work is resumed , men and women reorganizing the brigade of buckets and moving irreplaceable carpets and furniture to drying quarters . Sir Lawrence however has his attention directed elsewhere . "
" His rotting head raised in alarm , he swings his hanging leg back over the railing and breaks out into a jog , chain mail rippling with his movements.With his left hand , he loosens the sword from its scabbard , readying it in case . "
 *That was unnatural . Thunder before lightning ? Impossible . Save for one reason ... * 
" His heavy boots thud against the cold stone of the floor as he races past the portraits of previous rulers , their usual stern gaze darkening . Eyes drip like melted tallow , leaking darkness onto the grey stone . Mouths widen sickeningly , growing wider and wider until their smiles stretch from ear to ear . Needle like teeth are planted in gums black with rot grin at Lawrence as he begins to sprint . Dark parodies of his own affliction laugh at him , hissing in delight as a cold knot forms in his mummified throat . Rain drips onto Lawrence 's shoulder . Stealing a glance upwards , he witnesses the fresco overhead writhe in horrific fashion . Hundreds of beasts tear into one another . Hydras duel with griffins while phoenixes claw dragons before being roasted in bale-fire . Manticores are turned to stone upon gazing into the eyes of the Cockatrice . "
" Lawrence pays them no heed , instead barreling down the hallway and slamming the door at the end clean open . The inch thick oak cracks as he enters the room . "
" Queen Malvina is sitting down amongst physical darkness blacker than death itself . Kicking it up like fog as he makes his way towards her , the corners of his eyes glance around the room , at the corpses within the paintings that hang on the walls . His boots squelch from some unknown source hidden in the inky fog . Cradled within Malvina 's arms is the limp body of Dieter , portions of him visibly rotting , his bright shining teeth revealed through the gaping wound in his cheek . One arm is but bone with shreds of ligaments hanging on . His open eyes are pale and dim . "
" `` He 's dead ... '' She says softly , tears dripping down her cheeks . "
" Sir Lawerence kneels down , gently taking the form of Dieter from her hands . `` No . He 's not . ''
I know my roommate pretty well . Well , I guess `` knew him '' , rather since he convincingly killed me and left me for dead without me seeing it coming at all . He only buried me about 3 feet deep . Huge mistake on his part . He even dug my `` grave '' with a gardening shovel . A spade ? Would have been faster to actually stop somewhere and get a real shovel . He was really unprepared for this . "
" So it 's a rushed job ( he did n't even do a thorough checking of my vitals ) . So either it was a very emotionally motivated crime , or he was put up to it very `` on the spot '' . Regardless , when I see him again I 'll have to anticipate a very emotional and instinctual reaction . "
" Two days later , once I 've made the proper arrangements , he walks into the same apartment in which we 've shared beer and pizza ; that he , hours later , dragged out my `` not-quite-a-corpse '' rolled into our living room rug . His keys drop to the ground as he stares in total shock in the doorway . "
" `` How ? '' the roommate says softly and very slowly . <newline> I laugh . <newline> `` I 'm laughing because you 've dropped your keys on the floor again , and in 3..2.. '' <newline> The Roomba turns on , and as though it were malicious intent goes towards the keys and vacuums them up . <newline> `` Listen '' I say as I slowly swirl my scotch in its ' glass on a couch that we both pay for . `` I do n't know exactly why you did what you did . Frankly I do n't care , nor do I foster any resentment . You should know though , the game is on . '' "
" I shut the hall light off , walk to my room , and call it a night . Well , I peak my head back out my door at him to say `` Abandon all routine or this will be way too easy '' . I go to sleep . The game is on .
*Crack* . A large section of an old wall came crashing down . Dust and debris flew everywhere , a beam of water sprouted from somewhere , and yelling could be heard coming from upstairs . "
 ‘ What the hell is going on down there ? Phil ? PHIL ? Are you okay ? ’ 
" Phil shook his head , coughed a few times , patted his limbs , checking whether they were all there , and made his way towards the stairs . A loud ringing noise filled his ears . "
" ‘ Yeah , yeah , I ’ m okay , fine , nothing to worry about . It ’ s just a piece of old— ‘ "
" He fell silent , as he saw something amidst the mist of dust . A faint green light , blinking slowly , irregularly . Phil took out his flashlight from his utility belt and flipped the ‘ on ’ switch . No light . "
 ‘ Goddamn batteries . Should have bought the top brand . Where are the spare— ‘ 
 ‘ PHIL ! Do I need to come down there ? ’ interrupted the voice from upstairs . 
" ‘ No no , it ’ s okay . It ’ s just , the flashlight . Its , uhm , batteries— ‘ "
" Phil looked at the light again . It had started to blink more rapidly , and appeared to have moved a bit towards him . He felt the urge to meet it halfway , as if it was a love long lost , with who he finally reunited with . *Hug me , want me , kiss me , so close now , yes , almost , here , please , yes , YES , YEEESSS ! ! ! * "
 * * * * * 
" Phil regained consciousness , and Matt was standing over him . His mouth moved , but Phil heard no words , just the ringing sound . It had not faded . Phil never noticed it before , but Matt only had one green eye . *Curious , looks good on him though . Mysterious . Goes great with his fingers . Always liked that tentacle look , bet his wife appreciates the possibilities too . * "
" Slowly sound came back to Phil , and he could make out what Matt was saying . "
 ‘ Nakz-hal retk-ii . Nakz-hal retk-ii ! NAKZ ! ! NAKZ ! ! ! ’ 
" Matt ’ s eye had started to shine , like a blinking star . Bright green . First slowly , then rapidly . "
" Phil looked down at his body , and wondered where his legs went . <newline>
Dear Diary , I know its been a while but please forgive me . Earlier today when walking home from school I had a strange , no , the strangest thing that has ever happened to me happened today and I am totally freaking out . I was crossing Squash Creek on the north bridge like I do everyday after class . But this time when I approached the on ramp I noticed a small wooden stool sitting in the path . it was n't until I tried walking around it did I notice the..thing , I do n't know what to call it a troll maybe ? Yeah , a troll that makes sense . I met a troll today . At first I though it was some crude creation of some meth tweakers made of dead cats and fish but then this harry , scalie thing turned to me and gave me a grin . I was so taken back that I fell on my ass right there . If not for that I would have been out of there instantly , and the fact that this thing started to speak to me.. '' Easy there young-en ! '' it said in a disturbingly human voice `` Where be you off to in such a hurry '' ? Naturally I answered it . I spoke back to the `` troll '' , I must have been in shock still . `` I was just trying to cross here , I do it almost every day '' . It was silent for a moment after that then replied `` You see son , this is my bridge now '' ! `` And you cross it on my terms '' . He stuck some sort of crooked cane in my face as I started to get up to my feet . `` You must answer my riddle '' he choked out with a laugh . This was the point where I was convinced I had gone absolutely bonkers . I literally pinched myself which only aided in his laughter . `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence '' ? he said in a slow majestic voice . How was I supposed to know that ? It was probably some ancient proverb or great life lesson I had never heard of..I tried reasoning with the thing but it would n't have any . I had to answer it..otherwise I would have to walk four miles to the other crossing . Yeah right . I sat there for about twenty minutes watching it shoo flies away until I had settled on an answer . it never told me what would happen if I was wrong in my reply ... I opened my mouth to speak `` What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence '' ? I repeated . `` Its time to buy a new fence '' I said confidently . The trolls face showed no emotion until he suddenly erupted in laughter , he even fell off his stupid stool . Was I right I thought to myself . I then decided that while he mocks my wrong answer I was n't going to take any of that . I ran . I ran fast and did n't turn back . Now I 'm recording it all . Should I tell my parents ? What if it followed me ? Was my answer right ? I 'm not even sure it actually happened..
She knows what happens next because we are the hurricane and we are the flame . "
" Her wings are wet when she returns home to me tonight . The circle of fire that binds us together reflects in the tiny droplets on her blackdark wings - she lands , alight with the flame on my outstretched hands . I hold her close and she rests her weary head against my cold , white neck . I know that the rain has begun and nothing will stop it until the wicked city is washed away . "
" I know because I brought the rain . I brought the rain because I ’ ve been watching from a dark and dreamy world away . The night she first crash-landed into my arms , she cried and told me the story of how she came to be so battered and bruised . She took me to her home and I watched while her world was ravaged by fear and by hate . I watched and held her at night while she cried and begged for my help . I laid by her side and I strengthened my bond to her tortured world until I was strong enough to bring the rain that will wash it away . "
" And now here is my darling , worn weary from the battle she so willing fights , traveling faithfully between our two worlds . Her wings beat ever so softly against the fate of her world , creating new and beautiful patterns when she flies to my side . She is shot from the sky time after time , and still she returns to me , bruised and sometimes broken . I hold my precious , wounded bird gently against my heart . "
" I promised her rain . And after the rain , I will bring the fire . "
" I studied her world while she slept . I mastered the laws of nature in her world as I have in mine . I learned to control the tide that is tethered to her beating heart and the winds that are now controlled by her sleeping sighs . She doesn ’ t know the power I breathe into her when we meet in her dreams . I protect her from the chaos that she helps me create by clouding her memory of me while she ’ s awake . <newline> I have whispered my secrets into the girl ’ s ear while she sleeps . I have wanted her to know what I have planned for her world . I want her to know because our fates are now one and I know that one day she will remember . I need her to live so that she will continue to dream . In her dreams is where I find her , and from there that I work . "
" When she wakes , her sheets are damply tangled around her bare legs . She feels something lurking , perched in a far corner of her mind . There is a light tapping at her window and she recognizes the soothing sound of summer rain . Pulling aside the curtains , she smiles at the kids that are already splashing happily in the growing puddles . "
" “ I hope you know how to swim , ” she cheerfully whispers . <newline>
`` Throw that garbage out ! Right now ! '' "
" Jackson flinched as the words were barked by his superior , but hastily grabbed up the sketches he has lain on his boss 's desk mere moments ago . "
" `` Are-are you sure he wo n't work as a character ? '' Jackson asked again , finding that his voice was growing thinner the more his boss 's eyes furrowed . "
" `` Throw it out , Jackson , '' the voice came out a bitter hiss , a darkness emanating from behind the mahogany desk . `` Throw it out , or it 's your job that 's in the garbage . '' "
" Jackson nodded and quickly took off , dashing out of the office and back to his drawing desk . "
" He took one more sorrowed look at the sketch in his hands before sighing , feeding the leaves of paper into the shredder . He should have known not to show it to his boss . The artists around him had all complained about how offensive it was and that if that was the best Jackson could think of , he might as well turn in his resignation and burn his desk . "
" <newline> He guessed no one would ever like The OP .
It 's kind of a dick move that they sent me alone . "
 Not complaining . Mr. Alien Overlord said they only needed one guy . Mr. President asked Mr. General to recommend <newline> a Mr. Best-Marine-In-The-Army . Mr. General recommended Mr . Myself here . 
 So they stuck Mr . Myself here on a rocket and shipped me off to the Andromeda Galaxy . 
" `` Relax , '' Mr. Alien Overlord had said , `` It 'll be fine . '' "
" They gave me a small device like an iPod with a single button for a display and said , `` That is our technology . You don ’ t press the button until you watch the instructional video . '' "
 `` Where 's the instructional video ? '' 
 `` We 'll send it to you when it ’ s time . '' 
" Yeah . Ok. Of course I 'll do it . Racist aliens that want to eliminate every other species in the galaxy ? Yeah , I 'll help <newline> you fight them . Yeah , I trust that this box with a button will help me defeat a planet . Yeah , you got it under <newline> control . "
 But now I 'm getting closer to the planet . And no instructions . Nothing . 
 Dick move . For real . 
" I check through the windshield outside – the planet is red , and it 's growing closer . "
 What do I do if I get there and there 's no instructions ? Ask for directions ? Tell them I 'm lost ? Join them and become an intergalactic racist so I do n't die ? 
 I pull the button-device from my pocket and study it . I 've contemplated pressing the damn thing like a hundred times in the week it took for me to get here . 
" But they told me to wait . They told me to wait , so I 'm waiting . The dicks . "
" `` Identify yourself , '' comes a voice through my speakers . "
 Shit . 
 I look down at the button again . 
 `` Identify yourself now or we will open fire . '' 
 They see me . No more time . Crap . 
 I hover my hand over the button . 
" I hear the Overlord Alien 's voice , back at the meeting on Earth : `` *It is essential that you wait for instructions before pressing the button* . '' "
 `` This is your last warning . Identify yourself or we will – '' 
" The voice dies away in a hiss , like a radio switching between stations . I look up and my windshield is taken over by <newline> the Alien Overlord 's face . "
" `` Hello , Mr. Austin , '' the video starts . `` Thank you for waiting for the instructions before pressing the button . '' "
 `` How did you know I did n't press the – '' 
" `` A quick overview , before we talk more about the device you carry with you – our species has recently found out <newline> that the universe we all live in is – in fact – a simulation . '' "
" `` What ? '' I ask , like the video can hear me . "
" `` After some debating , we decided that this did n't really matter , since we had no way of getting out of the <newline> simulation . So we carried on with our lives . '' "
" `` Well , that does make sense… '' "
" `` Like all simulations , however… Universe has some… glitches . Bugs you can exploit , if you get access to the source code . '' "
 I look down at the button again . 
" `` That is all you need to know . Please use the device in your possession with responsibility , and return it to us once <newline> you 've finished your mission . Best of luck and… have fun . '' "
" The Overlord disappears , and my windshield goes back to reflecting the red planet , where a bunch of black ships are now hovering in front of it , their laser guns pointed my way . "
 `` Ready to open fire ! '' comes the voice again . 
" The button looks up at me , and I look down at it . "
" `` Fuck it , '' I say , pressing down on it . "
" A screen rises from the device like a hologram , flashing in blue . A menu . "
 
 ***CHEATS*** 
 
 *INFINITE LIFE* 
 *INFINITE AMMO* 
 *EXPLOSIVE BULLETS* 
 *GIANTS HEADS* 
 *ALL WEAPONS* 
 *SUMMON MR. MEESEEKS* 
 *ARMOR UP* 
 *LIFE UP* 
 
" In slow motion , I look from the menu to the windshield , where more and more ships gather around me . "
" `` Open fire ! '' comes the voice , and the laser guns shift my way . "
" `` Oh , this is going to be fun , '' I say , feeling a smile creeping into my face as I press the first option on the menu .
I hated doing this , ibutI had to . It was always the same . The peeling wallpaper in the train compartment , The uncomfortable seats , the boring English countryside , father 's breath ticking away the time . I had to sit perfectly still or father would start to get angry , and he did terrible things while calm , he was horrible when he was angry . "
" `` You must be calm . This is a dance we are doing . We must be perfect or it will all go terribly . I would be most upset if things went poorly . '' My father spoke with a perfect cadence , every word a measured thing . "
" `` I know this , Father . I hate that you do it this way . That you must make me do these things . It 's terrible . '' I mumbled softly while watching the clock . It was three fifty-seven am . The plan was to go into effect at four . "
" `` We have spoken on this . You will continue to do as instructed . I will hear no more of this . '' Father explained , his voice hard and cruel . "
" The next three minutes were horrible . We sat there in perfect silence , both of us watching the clock . Once it stroke seven I stood and opened the train door . I waved down one of the workers , She waved back and started walking my way . The plan had to start exactly at four , four hours after the train set off from London . This was the time when the worker would be finishing her rounds and not be noticed for another three hours . "
" I stepped back into the carriage and sat down . Father smiled at me from where he hid behind the door . The stewardess peaked her head in a question on her lips . I spoke my lines , they had been practiced a thousand times before father said I got them right . `` Oh . I do n't mean to bother , but the blinds on this window are tricky and the sun is blinding . '' As I spoke I knew the girl 's fate was sealed . "
" She stepped into the carriage to fix the blind . My father moved quickly , as he plunged a knife into the girl 's neck . She did not have time to scream before crumpling to the floor . `` You see boy . Nobody can take this from us . This was a perfect plan . Nobody will know what happened to her . All the waiting was worth it . '' He always loved his speeches after a kill . "
" I moved just as quickly as he did when I buried my own knife into his spine . `` You always plan to much old man . I had to wait months for this kill . Why spend months planning on ten seconds of bliss . I 'm done with you father . '' I hissed in his ear as his body collapsed onto hers . Father 's plan was perfect . Exactly at this moment , the train was moving over a bridge , so nobody noticed the bodies being pushed out of the window to plummet into the icy waters below . "
" I laid down for the best sleep I had had in years .
its been 5 days . no , maybe 6 . At this point the number of days does n't seem to matter much . Im much more concerned about how we will get food and water . Theres only three of us ; me , my Co worker Tommy , and a random named Jason . Our best guess is that an all out war broke out and there probably are n't many people left in the city that we 're in , we got hit pretty hard . I could see nothing but plains , trucks , tanks , missiles , and bullets when i was on my way to grab a late dinner and head back to the office . Not only was there an overwhelming amounts of military presence , but there were some strange aircrafts that I , nor Tommy could identify . We took refuge in the basement of the office , i guess working late finally paid off because my apartment building was completely demolished from what i could see . We saw a man running for his life jus before we headed for the basement so we let him in , introduces himself as Jason , and that was that . "
" Day 7 : So far we 've been pretty understanding as to why Jason has seemed a little ... off . I mean , the man says he has a family that he has no idea if they are okay , nor would i guess that they are . The entire world as we know it could be crumbling and or completely gone by now ; we 're all a little stressed to say the least . But Jason seems to have a certain trait about him that we ca n't put our finger on . His slouched posture , very long arms , and almost always bent knees give him an eerie appearance . His words are slurred and jumbled to the point that you would think he 's either wasted or just learned the language ... we 're going to be keeping an eye on him . "
" Day 8 : We broke into a locked supply closet on the 4th floor and found a couple cases of water and granola bars mixed in with office supplies , so we 've bought ourselves a little bit more time . Once again , Jason has given me more reasons to be suspicious of his motives . We all decided to check each floor for supplies since our situation was getting dire and we needed food and water . I took the 2nd , Tommy took the 3rd , and Jason was given the 4th . After searching to no avail me and Tommy met back up on the main floor and doubled over each of our floors to make sure we did n't miss anything . Jason then met us soon after on the 2nd floor and said he did n't find anything either . `` okay '' i replied , `` we 're double checking each of the floors just to make sure we did n't miss anything . help us clear this one and the 3rd then we 'll go up to the 4th and check that one again as well . '' Jason then seemed very reluctant to the idea and even accused me of not trusting him . That 's okay , were all hungry and on edge . I calm but firmly tell him that our only motives are to find some supplies to help us last a little while longer until we can find some better placement other than this ( office that i love being in so much . ) So , as a team , we make it to the 4th floor and conduct our search . not 10 minutes in we come across a locked door that almost looked like someone was trying to hide it . strange , i thought . how could Jason miss this door that was pretty much right infant of your face when you walk up the stairs . i shrugged it off and said `` lets bust it open . Theres bound to be something useful in there . '' Tommy , mirroring my confusion of Jason , was down . Grabbed a chair and made his way to the door to help me bust it down . Its been a few hours since and Jason 's only take a couple sips of water and has n't touched the granola bar . Im not sure how he 's still standing considering how long we 've gone without food or water . More for us i guess ... "
" Day 10 : Tommy 's gone . I finally found the ease of mind to take a nap for a little while and upon waking up i see Jason in his corner and Tommy 's nowhere to be found . `` uh..where 's Tom ? '' i ask Jason , `` Oh I 'm not sure . he said he wanted to go check out the 4th floor again for more supplies . He should be back soon . '' he said in a very calm tone . That 's reasonable , i thought . `` Ill go join him , I 'm pretty curious as well . '' `` NO '' pleads Jason , '' what ? '' i replied , `` i mean , uh , I tried to go with him too . He said we should stay down here . He wanted to be alone for a little while . '' `` ... alright . i guess ill stay here then . '' That just does n't seem like Tom to me . My watch broke when breaking into that closet but I 've got to imagine Its been close to 4 hours since I 've woken up and he
Paul 's technique was so simple that a few years ago the department had paid him a large bonus to help publish a training video with the hope that other detectives would be able to adopt his strategy and begin closing their cases at a higher rate . Paul 's 100 % conviction rate was unprecedented and the higher ups wanted more than anything to crack his code . Problem was , and Paul knew this when they had asked him to make the video , that his technique would n't work for anyone other than himself . Though he had n't let that small detail keep him from agreeing to do it in order to gain a few extra dollars . See , Paul knew he could do anything he wanted and be a rich man using his `` gift '' but Paul was n't a greedy man . Truth was that he truly enjoyed his job and the sense of accomplishment he received from helping his small community by getting people that he knew were truly guilty of their crime off the street . "
 Over the years Paul had become a legend among local law enforcement officers and it was n't uncommon for most of the department and sometimes even the mayor to stop what they were doing and come to watch his interrogation from behind a one way mirror . 
" Although murders were n't unheard of by any means , this case was so horrendous that even the FBI had come to town to help handle the investigation . The crime had been on the news for several days prior to them finally tracking down their only suspect , and the whole town was still in shock from what few details had leaked out . Word around town was there were so many body parts that the officers had n't been able to determine the number of victims , and it had been nearly a week ! One thing the detectives and FBI officers working the case did know was that the victims had n't come from this town . In fact they could n't find where the victims had come from at all . Preliminary DNA results were n't providing any leads and the detectives had nothing to go on other than a vague description , given by a well known homeless drunkard , of a tall man in a dark coat . The drunkard had told officers that he saw the man leaving the park , where the bodies had been found , and walking towards a local motel . The officers had went directly to the motel where they found the strange man and brought him into the station without incident . "
" Even though the FBI was leading this investigation , they were aware of Paul 's flawless conviction record and agreed that he should be the one to question this strange man ; the only possible suspect they that had . "
" So Paul began his interview process the same as he always did , just like he had done for the training videos , by being very friendly to the man and offering him food , drinks , cigarettes etc . The man politely declined all of Paul 's offerings and continued to sit there across the table with the same blank expression on his face he had when the officers initially arrested him . "
" None of this phased Paul as he knew he would have the answers to all of his questions in no time . Considering his audience , he decided to cut straight to it , Paul hit him with the key phrase that he had become famous for . `` You know exactly why you are sitting right here , right now , right in front of me do n't you ? '' "
" Paul had asked this question countless times of guilty men who usually responded with something like `` no I have no idea '' and their minds would then begin racing , actually answering the question thus telling Paul everything he needed to know . "
" However , Paul was not ready for what happened when he asked this strange man the `` famous key phrase , '' and neither were all of the FBI agents , detectives , and even the Governor who had made a special trip into town to watch . "
" **Taking a break , will continue if Reddit tells me that I should . : )
`` Peter we 've been through this a million times , actually more . I do n't know what you expect us to say . '' "
" A group of paper-pushers busied themselves , avoiding Peter 's eyes while Peter smoked a cigarette , anxiously flicking it . "
" An individual by the name of MATT BERG recently arrived for process and neither subsequent departments ( Heaven , Hell ) were willing to take him . However , this posed a problem for both departments . Typically speaking , this type of situation was very rare - the last similar case had occurred pre-resurrection and , fittingly , their had been a slew of departmental policy changes following the shakeup . According to some of the older department heads it had been a logistical nightmare . "
" Peter finished his cigarette , exhaled , and spoke : "
" `` The way I see it , we only have one option . Send Matt back and , with any luck , we wo n't have to deal with this mess the next time around ... I mean , what are the odds he 'll come back with an even count ? Albeit possible it 's hardly probable . '' "
 Mother Teresa chimed in : 
 `` You ca n't do that without a sign-off from the boss . See Lazarus Edict 2012.7 '' 
 Peter looked at Teresa with malice ... This politicking bitch had been nothing but a series of bureaucratic headaches since her hire . 
" `` Okay then , what do you propose , Teresa ? Because all I 'm hearing are rebuttals sans solutions ... something you 've gained a knack for , I might add . '' "
" Teresa busied herself with paperwork , paying no mind to Peter 's not-so-subtle underhand remark . "
 `` Bring it to JC 's attention and that will be that . '' 
 Was this bitch serious ? As if JC did n't have enough shit on his plate . Peter was reaching his breaking point . Michael walked into the room . 
 `` What 's up my people ? Heard through the cloud-line that we got ta Lazarus case on our hands ? Am I sending someone back ? Just give me the word and -- '' 
 Teresa chimed in : 
 `` No because we do n't have JC 's sign-off . Peter knows this . '' 
 God-damn whore . 
" `` Teresa , take 15 . '' "
 `` I took my 15 107 years ago I 'm not due for another until -- '' 
 `` TAKE 15 TERESA . '' 
 Teresa glared at Peter and slowly shuffled out . About fucking time . 
 Michael sat down in Teresa 's chair and lit a cigarette . 
" `` What seems to be the issue Pete ? Something tells me you wan na expedite without the boss man signing off ... Which I 'm all for , but I 'd at least like an explanation . '' "
 Peter paused . He might as well get it off his chest . 
" `` Listen , JC is bogged down and I do n't wan na be the guy who tells him we got another potential Lazarus case ... And if I have to deal with that headache , rest assured you will too . '' "
 Michael smiled and ashed his cigarette on Teresa 's desk . 
" `` Alright Pete , I can swing it but we 'll need to talk to Bon down in Hell if we want to swing it without Teresa sounding the alarm . I hate bureaucratic bullshit as much as the next angel but I also like my job and am not about to get shuffled off to Hell to work under Bon ... the guy 's been playing Highway to Hell on repeat since he moved into his new office . Fucking cock . '' "
" `` Well , let 's get it going then . I want this finished before Teresa comes back from her 15 . '' "
" We took the inter-dimensional tram over to Hell and , after lengthy , unnecessary vetting by the security guard , were let in . As we arrived at Bon 's office the song `` Girls Got Rhythm '' blared from the inside . "
" `` At least he switched things up . This is a jam . Reminds me of a party I was at in Sodom & Gomorrah , Lot was hooking up with a straight 10 . A shame , really . '' "
" All the suits outside of Bon 's office were surprisingly professional . Truth be told , it looked like they had a more efficient system than Peter had over in Heaven . When Peter and Michael entered Bon 's office he was in the middle of a phone call . "
" `` I do n't give a damn if she wants a transfer . This is fucking Hell and we 're the department heads ... Yes of course and no definitely not . You and I both know what Lucifer 's response to that will be ... Okay , let me know how it goes . '' "
 Bon hung up and smiled . 
 `` Gentleman . What brings you to these parts ? Let me guess ... looking for wiggle room with a potential Lazarus edict discrepancy ? '' 
 Bon was a cocky little shit . Peter spoke : 
 `` You obviously know why were here . So what 'll it be ? '' 
" Bon drew the blinds . His office had a wicked view of the
Holy shit trains , "
" Trains for days , "
" My Scale Electric , "
 Rail way . 
" It had tunnels and turns , "
 And signals and sound . 
" I 'd watch as they travelled , "
 Around and around . 
" They never went far , "
" My bedroom was small , "
 But my imagination 
 Made up for it all . 
 `` Here it comes again ! '' 
" I 'd scream in delight , "
" Playing for hours , "
 From morning till night . 
 - 
" But then came a time , "
 When I could n't play ... 
" I must 've been bad , "
" Cause dad took them away , "
" I said I was sorry , "
" I asked what to do , "
" But then Daddy left , "
 And he took the car too .

" Dad married again , "

 Without my toy train .

They tell us that the darkness is feared simply because it is unknown . That may have fooled me when I was young but now I think I know better . They told us never to go near the place where the darkness resides , but I saw someone go there the other night . I followed . Along the winding path , I could only hear the leaves rustle and my own faint footsteps . Ahead of me was the figure , walking briskly down the path . "
" I flicked on my dim flashlight and kept it pointed on the ground . I defeated the darkness before me with the light . It closed itself around me , embracing me in a chilled choke-hold . I suddenly got the screaming urge to turn around . I should have . Whomever I was following has disappeared from my sight , another victim enveloped by the darkness . How scarcely we learn from our mistakes . "
" I do n't know how I got home but when I awoke , but it was dark . I rushed to flip my lightswitch to once again defeat the darkness . There was a note pinned to my door , confirming my suspicion that someone brought me here . It simply read `` Do n't '' . And I wo n't . The elders were right .
**October 7 , 2046** "
 They rode in silence . 
" The crew compartment was stuffy , cramped . Slim tendrils of blue smoke snaked from the captain ’ s cigar , dancing in the red running light . John sat with his back to the hull , listening to the dull roar of the hoverjets , the mechanical chorus of readied weapons , the whispered prayers . "
" This was the third year of the operation , the largest ground war in living memory . Before they shipped out the CO had praised their bravery , their courage , their strength . They were rebuilding America , one city block at a time . They would be remembered as heroes . "
 * “ Thirty seconds ! ” * 
" The call came through his headset . Within the claustrophobic confines of his helmet John watched his heads-up display flare to life ; suit vitals , overhead map , bullet-pointed objectives . "
" He looked around at the up-armored soldiers around him , watched as they went through their pre-battle rituals . He tried to guess who they were beneath the dull , emotionless visors . "
" The captain rose , cradling her helmet under one arm , the other bracing against the hull . “ Alright , listen up , ” she shouted over the bubbling commotion , “ our target is an insurrectionist strong hold out past Old Seattle . Reports indicate a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition has been moved underground , into the subway tunnels . They ’ ve been peppering our boys for weeks , and we ’ re gon na stop em . So check your weapons , keep your heads down , and don ’ t get killed. ” "
" John could see the exhaustion in her eyes , the haunted thousand-yard stare so common among the veterans . The captain surveyed the soldiers , nodded , and slipped on her helmet . With a wave of her hand the thirty men and women rose . "
" The light shifted green , the transport landed with a spine-jarring impact , and the rear hatch hissed open . Into chaos . "
 *** 
" His head pounded , he could taste blood . John came to with a start , fighting for breath . His vision was dark . For a heartbeat he feared he was blind , until a small , red warning icon flashed before his eyes . "
" John reached up , undid the clasps around his neck , and tossed his dented helmet aside . He was on his back , staring up at a smoke-clouded sky . He could hear the staccato retorts of small arms fire echoing across the city , the tortured screams . He tried to rise , but collapsed when his knee buckled . He looked down and nearly vomited at the site of his leg . "
" A nearby explosion shook him to his senses , and he took in the scene around him . The transport listed over him , nearly toppled . It had touched down along a residential street lined with burned-out houses and smoking craters , before meeting its end ; the front half had been ripped open and was dripping molten slag on the cracked pavement . There were bodies . "
" He felt for his rifle , but it was gone . He reached for his sidearm , but it too was missing . He pulled the reserve radio from his belt and scanned through the channels , but all that returned was static . A thought surfaced through the daze ; get off the street . "
" Bracing himself , John rose on his elbows and crawled away from the smoldering wreck , wincing as his mangled leg jostled along the uneven ground . He didn ’ t know where to go , just that he should be away . His head was spinning , and he had to stop several times to catch his breath and fight back the encroaching darkness . "
" Feeling his strength returning , John reached out for a fallen tree branch and hoisted himself to his feet , using the limb as a crutch . Before him was a house , relatively untouched by the flames and the battle , and through his addled mind he figured it to be a safe place to hide , to wait for reinforcements . There would be reinforcements , right ? "
" John looked around , but the street remained empty , save for the occasional crow swooping in for a feast . The shelter of the house called to him , reached out . He doubled his pace . "
" As he hobbled up the driveway , past the scorched hulk of a minivan , he did a double-take . There , in the window , was a face , for just a moment . Ignoring his mounting fears , he called out , a desperate wordless plea . "
" He stumbled , landing on the ruined remains of his leg . The world swam , he tasted copper , and the darkness swept over him like a warm wave . "
 *** 
" John awoke to a sharp pain in his leg . He tried to call out , but his throat was parched , and all he could manage was a wheeze . "
" He looked around through crusted eyes ; he was in a room , thin streams of light filtering through pin-prick bullet holes . As his eyes adjusted to the dark , he began make out figures , sheltered in the gloom . "
" As the past events surfaced in his memory , John instinctively pushed himself upright and nearly swooned as the
I 've been driving all night , and most of the day before it . It does n't help that it gets dark at like , four in this god-forsaken state . To make matters worse , just like every other state with more cows than people , it 's absolutely frigid . If I see one more empty cornfield , I might just scream . "
" I glance down at the radio . Two AM , exactly three minutes from the last time I checked it . On the bright side , that means only about six more hours of driving . On the other hand , I 've been on the road for about ten hours more than that . "
" There are a small collection of lights up ahead ; I utter a silent thanks to whatever may be listening , as I have three Red Bulls and a Gatorade 's worth of a piss to take . The town is tiny , and the 'Welcome ' sign says it on both sides . I always thought places that small were a joke . "
" Really , it 's a wonder this collection of farmers that happen to live next to each other has the traffic for a 24 hour gas station , but here it is . I pull up in front of it , and briefly consider turning off my engine . 'Fuck that , ' I think to myself . I 'm not getting back into a freezing car , and the twelve people that live in this town are either asleep or working in a gas station . I step out , careful not to hit the 'lock ' button as I exit . This is not a place one should be stuck out of their car . "
" The high-school aged kid working the till does n't even look up from his phone as he mutters something unintelligible that I assume is a greeting . I grunt back in kind , and go into the bathroom to take the most glorious leak of my life . On my way out , I buy one of those 1.5 liter 'travel sized ' waters , just because I hate stopping at a place just to use the facilities . "
" The exchange is over , and I brave 15 yards of frigid weather to get back into my warm car that I 'll spend the next quarter-day in and pull out of the lot . 2:16 AM . Could time pass any slower ? "
" I sort of zone out for a while . Straight roads , dead of winter , not a single other car since about 10 PM , what reason is there to pay attention ? I snap back to reality when I hear it . "
" The song . Everyone says something douchy about it . `` You 'll know when you hear it . '' `` I could never even begin to explain it '' . Without exception , I responded with a smart ass remark , never believing a word . But it 's loud . So loud , I worriedly begin to look for a train , or a semi honking at me , about to end my life before I realize how beautiful it is . I 'm nearly brought to tears listening to it , like some cheesy choir of angels was descending , telling me what was about to happen . "
" The voice is the sweetest thing I 've ever heard . Like honey pouring into my ears . I 'm so entranced by it , I would n't have even noticed the gun if not for the cold metal against the back of my head . "
" `` Hey , sweetie , '' the apparent love of my life says softly . `` I 'm still gon na need you to pull the car over . ''
As the sky darkened and clouds moved in , a burst of lightning illuminated the charcoal sky and the surroundings low rises of Newarc , New Jersey . The artificial lights flickered to match the rhythm of the thunder . Above the operating table dressed in white robes , the Doctor was at work once again . After his last monster laid waste to his ancestral land in Europe , the Doctor was forced to exile himself . He chose the new world . With the town of Newarc in New Jersey as his home base , the Doctor was hard at work once again . This time with a plan to avenge those who wronged him . The thunder roared once again , masking the knocking at the door . He didn ’ t hear the door slam open . It was Vincenza from the beauty salon on the ground floor , rollers still in her hair . With the spray tan on half of her body , she looked like she stepped into a mud pool on her way over . And with the expression on her face she looked more so the monster that jumped out of that pool . "
" Sneaking up on the Doctor she screamed , “ Hey would ya keep it down we got ta clients down der ! ” "
" The Doctor sprang into the air , surgical wire in hand . "
" “ Oh my gwad what are ya up to ? ” Vincenza , a New Jersey native and mob wife , confronted him in her thick Italian-America accent full of its nasality and coated with nosiness . She couldn ’ t wait to see how this juicy piece of potential gossip would unfold . Her eyes widened . "
" “ Erm ah um , vell I vaz jast doing some…threading ” The Doctor answered nervously in his thick German accent . He has been caught , he thought . After what happened in his homeland , he did not want to move again . Argentina would be his next destination ; he has friends from his homeland ’ s academia in exile there . But as a vegetarian with Crohn ’ s he wanted to avoid steak and wine . Plus his grade school bully was from Buenos Aires . He did not want to bring back those painful memories . "
 “ Oh threading ! We do it all o ’ da time down der in our shop . We got some hawt badies comin ’ in today for a canstest and dey got ta look a real good . Real gold. ” 
" `` Bodies you say ? ” The Doctor ’ s shoulders and arms lowered and relaxed . A puzzled look came on his face . His creations were puzzles , and he personally carved the pieces . He was looking for a few items to compose his jigsaw . "
" “ Oh ye ! The hawtest badies in the state . Hell , the hawtest badies in da East of da country are a comin ’ a here . Happenin ’ in our salon in a half ’ a hour . You should come and checka her out . But keep da noise down ‘ cause we got ta get a finished making dem golden – if ya know what I mean sweethart. ” Vincenza turned around and bounced towards the door like the jumpy mud monster that she looked like . Thinking she had the latest scoop on the new neighbour upstairs , who was now a mysterious eyebrow threader , she couldn ’ t wait to share the news with her gals . She slammed the door behind her . "
" The Doctor was gleeful . That stupid monster has just handed him the parts for his next project . He removed his lab coat and ran to the back of the apartment . Climbing through the window , one leg at a time , he stumbled and fell onto the fire exit . The clumsy nerd that he was , he managed to tumble down the fire exit steps ; the slippery rails and freshly wet steps helped him lose his balance . He forced his way through the back door of the beauty salon . There , his eyes widened and he froze . A tree of a man , with skin brown as oak bark and wide as the trunk , with a black hedgehog for hair stood in the narrow hallway behind the door and brought down his tiny dark eyes to stare at him . "
" “ Hey boy you is a late . You must be dat natural fitness guy dey was a talkin ’ about . Scrawny as a mozzarella stick and soggy as a old pizza , ” The tree laughed , his roaring laughter shaking the walls <newline> “ Look at a yo scrawny self , and pale too . Good luck . But take a ya shirt and pants aff first , don ’ t be a wuss. ” "
" The Doctor was too afraid to say no . His Argentinian childhood bully taught him not to fight back . He complied . As he removed his clothes , his pale skin brightened up the room . As soon as he was in his bleached tighty-whities , the tree pushed him through a set of heavy and dark doors a few steps down the narrow hallway . The lights blinded him , and he covered up his eyes . The roaring laughter of the crowd pained his gentle academic ears , used to library volume . He squinted and viewed what was in front of him through the gaps in between his fingers…and froze ... <newline>
I 'm sitting opposite a man . Someone who I had never met before in person but who 's life I have memorized in its totality . My childhood has always been rather hazy , so I feel as though I 've supplemented it with pictures of happiness found in the old , meticulous diary entries of the individual before me . It is n't the first time I 've done this . The only way to get someone to talk is to truly become the them . Truth is as relative as the universe in which it has been conceived and I for one have created a very relative universe for myself . "
" `` Blink once for a yes and twice for a no , do you understand ? '' "
 'Blink ' 
" The white walls of the eight by ten room had recently really started to take a toll on me , but they served a purpose . There was a certain spaceless quality it imbued that allowed me to pull the mark out of the real world , and into one of my own creation . "
" `` Now , I am going to show you a short clip . You will not like the contents of this video . You are to watch the whole thing and will not close your eyes or look away for it 's duration . Is this also understood ? '' "
" A pair of piercing blue eyes stared back defiantly . The man to whom they belonged sat in an uncomfortable looking slouch . His balding head seemed to be attracted to his left shoulder , mirroring the way his penis rested on his left testicle . He looked retched . The bruising on his shoulders and chest told a story of the failed attempts of amateurs , trying to make him talk . I know this ploy , I do n't like using words and speak only for my job . This is a luxury i enjoy utilizing . I am an artist and my work is performed always for an audience of one . "
" `` Your compliance is unnecessary to me . I merely ask it of you in order to allow this process to go on in a reasonably amicable fashion . If you do not want to follow my instructions , this sharp blade can produce the same effect . I find the removal of eyelids to be a dreadfully tedious task . I 'll take your response to be yes and continue . '' "
 At the end of the day this was all foreplay . Once the video came on he would not be able to avert his gaze . I pressed the play button and sat back in my chair .

" Onto the screen flashed a distorted image of a dining room . In the middle of it was a grand mahogany table , all around which were seated three people . The group consisted of a women and two small children ; a boy and a girl . When he saw this the man 's eyes widened in fear . How could I know who these people were ? How could I know of their existence ? Who they were is of no relevance to me . It was sufficient that they inspired the reaction that I received . I was told that the man was a loner with no affiliation . It seems the people who told me this were wrong . "
" In the centre of the table was a metronome slowly ticking back and forth . It was going at a rather steady pace . `` Tack , tick , Tack , tick . '' Along with that there was a slow chant just barely audible . "
" `` Tell , him , Tell , him ... '' "
 The man 's eyes were saucers . I must admit the image was really quite striking . Each of my participants were alternatively striking the table with each word . You could visibly hear his pulse as the pace of the metronome started to quicken . I had really outdone myself on the aesthetic . 
 'Crack ' . 
" The sound of a head kissing mahogany . The woman had stopped here movements . The young children were visibly distressed and started to make their way around the table to her . Shit , this was not supposed to happen . How the fuck was I to know that she had so few words left . God fucking dammit . I should have fucking known . "
 `` PHTHWAK ! '' 
" The much louder sound of a man hitting the floor . I spun around to see two lifeless eyes staring back at me . Did he fucking say something ? Shit I must have missed it during the commotion of the video . I 've got to check the tape , what the fuck did he say . "
" I run out of the door and into my equipment room where the tape is still rolling . Rewind , rewind , rewind , fucking play . "
 The audio comes on and there is the unmistakable sound of the first crack of head meets table . I focus the sound and turn it up . I tiny rasp echo 's in my ears as its amplified to gargantuan proportions ... 
 `` Soon '' .

I remember vividly the day that it happened . I was driving through a nasty storm in a dense forest , when suddenly a bright light flashed through my windscreen ! I was blinded ! I lost control of the steering and knew it was the end , and for some unknown reason I shouted “ Jesus take the wheel ! ” I don ’ t know why I said what I said , but maybe it saved me in a way . "
" <newline> I survived the crash… If you want to call it that . The car was parked on the side of the road . But , then I noticed I was in the passenger seat . Had I parked the car and moved to the passenger seat ? But , I couldn ’ t have . The engine was still running , and I would have remembered ! I thought , Maybe I should get some sleep before I DO crash . I turned to the driver ’ s seat to turn the ignition off . But then the true horror revealed its self ! The Devil himself was sitting in the driver ’ s seat ! "
" <newline> After a good solid minute of screaming and trying to get out of the car , he said , “ Will you stop that now ! ? ” The realisation came to me that I wouldn ’ t be getting out of the car any time soon . So I looked over . He was also looking at me . He had two black horns sticking out of his red head . They were rather sharp . His teeth as yellow as a banana ! His dark red hand with sharp purple finger nails where resting on the steering wheel . “ Wha… What… do you want ? ” "
" <newline> “ I want YOUR services ! ” The devil smirked . “ If you accept you can go on your merry way . If you so choose not to… Well let ’ s just say you won ’ t be making it out of this forest tonight. ” Just then an image flew into my mind . It was of a body . My body ! It was in a lake , the entrails everywhere ! It scared me more than it should have . "
 <newline> Now a great way is happening and I have managed to sneak out of the Devils reaches .

I watched as the purple balloon soared through the sky . I could only hope the queen would like it . The contents of the letter were trivial . What was really important was the picture in the back . I would love to see the look on the Queen 's face when she got to look at it . Not as if she would , though . There was a million to one possibility that the letter would actually arrive at its destination . "
" Days passed by and I forgot about my deed . The menial tasks and routines blended into the normalcy of life in London . After a few weeks , during my usual trip to the mailbox , I found a letter with the Royal seal of Her Majesty . My jaw dropped to the floor and then some . Did my letter actually get to the Head of State ? "
" Trembling with excitement I grabbed the letter and ran up to my room . Mother looked at me and sighed . She must 've thought `` This kid never stops. '' . Little did she know that I was about to read the single , most important piece of writing in my life . "
" I gawked at the envelope . I was a rather simple one , but the majesty of it , knowing where it came from , seeing the Royal Seal stamped on the back of it made one thousand times more shocking . I grabbed dad 's letter opener and cut open the envelope . A magnificently folded piece of paper slid out . I unfolded it with a hurry and read : "
 *Dear Andrew : * 
" *I have received your letter and read it thoroughly . My , what a lovely boy you are . I would love the chance to have tea with you sometime over the summer . You seem like a very educated kid . I like that in my nation 's youth . * "
" *Please , do make yourself time and stop by the Palace . I will wait . You can bring your mother and father , even brothers and sisters if you have them . * "
" *Just show the guards at the entrance this letter , have them contact me and I will let you and your family in . * "
" *Best Regards , Queen Elizabeth* "

Today was the day . "
" When I heard that my daughter 's killer had lost his latest appeal , I had started waiting for this day . At six foot eight the man was powerful . He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs . I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day . I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself . "
" Instead , one unusually cold day in October , he went up to Katie 's car , pulled a gun , and demanded that she get out . Katie had always been a fierce girl , not one to let anybody tell her what to do . I 'd taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions , but her attitude got the better of her . And then she was dead . "
" It was n't the crime he was sentenced to death for , but a life of crime always had casualties . One of his just happened to mean something to me . "
" The day of his execution , I waited with baited breath for the request . I 'd cooked lobster , pizzas , and apple pies . I 'd made the last hour of many men 's lives slightly better . I could n't imagine what this man would want . I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make . "
" Two hours before his execution by lethal injection , I received a piece of paper . I leaned over the counter and opened it up . "
 Grilled Cheese and Fries . I got to work .

" Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer 's cell . I peered in at the large man , sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands . After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face . "
 He was crying . 
" I opened the slot and slid the tray in . Once he had a hold of it , I let go and turned away . "
 `` I 'm sorry . '' 
" I froze , unsure of what to say . The man had killed Katie . He had made life harder for Katie 's mother and myself , and he had done it over a shitty '93 Jeep Cherokee . I turned . "
 He stared into my eyes and said it again . 
 `` I 'm sorry . I really am . ''

A foreign emotion I rarely experienced , but had felt it enough to know what I was being subjected to . I then opened my eyes to see me . I was standing there in the secret place I only knew , the place that would usher so many to the place of rest and reward but for some reason this view was different . "
" I looked down and saw I was kneeling , and for some reason wearing a torn skirt , with chains around my ankles . I looked back up and involuntarily let out a shriek as my beloved sledgehammer came down upon my own skull , and yet I feel nothing , a perfect hit instantly turning the brain into a puddle within the skull . Yet somehow I open my eyes and see myself in the same spot , only wearing different clothes this time , with a gag in my mouth as I , the true I , not the bastardized version of some mongrel only fit to serve myself in the afterlife that I currently find myself in ; walk up and , using my left hand , lovingly caress the neck of the body I find myself in . I pull back , knowing what is about to happen but can not stop the muffled scream from coming as the other hand comes forward lightning fast and plunges an ice pick into the eye of the body I currently reside in . It does not kill me as I knew it would n't , this time I wanted to see how a subject would react to a slower death , and I screamed in pain as the pick went into my ocular cavity , breaking into the bone found below the eye . Though it felt like an eternity he , for I was no longer him , removed the pick from my eye and mercifully penetrated my temple , ending my short and pathetic , yet somehow tragically beautiful life . "
" I was not surprised as I became the third victim , and the fourth . Each experiencing unique deaths . No I did not appreciate the way I slew myself as I had when I was only the one preparing the afterlife . This time I thought back to the strange memories I had been suppressing , the hopes and dreams that were not mine . I thought of my widowed mother whose husband had died trying to defuse an IED in Afghanistan , wondering how she could survive losing another she loved . Or to my basset hound at my apartment , hoping one of my friends would come by like they promised they would and notice me missing . "
" When I became the fifth I tried to fight the monster before me . Actually managing to sprain his ankle before he shattered my knee . I had just been accepted into the Police Academy the day I went out drinking and disappeared for 3 months , only to be found by a game warden during deer season . As the sixth I plead for my life despite realizing this was my punishment from God for raping those girls in college . "
" Finally , as the 7th I felt peace . I watched as the FBI SWAT team burst into the shed , serendipitously matching the first burst of blood escaping the arteries in my neck , as the beast before me jerked the hand holding the knife , taking with it my final chance at life , jerked outward from the first stab made into my neck . I laughed as the 5.56mm rounds fired by the Agents entered the depraved monsters ' body . But my laughs only came out as choking gasps . I could feel myself bleed out both as this poor soul on the floor , who was watching the team medic desperately try to pinch off his arteries , and as the monster I finally realized I truly was . The only odd thing I felt as I slipped towards whatever hell I surely deserved , was a feeling of elation ; knowing society was finally free of me .
Genetics are such a strange thing , such a bizarre coincidence of DNA and traits . Take me for example . I have a very unique genome . Immutable , my doctor calls it . Apparently that means that even when bitten by a vampire , attacked by a werewolf , or even cursed by magic , I remain human . Stubbornly so , in fact . I 'm nearly 1400 years old , yet another strange trait of my immutable genome . My cells replicate perfectly , giving me a theoretical immortality and I do n't really get sick . Like I said , genetics are funny . When I was born , I remember being treated as a freak , someone strange and different . My doctors took a lot of blood and tissue samples , and I remember spending a lot of time with needles in me . Then of course , came the Upheaval . "
" It started about fifty years after I was born , and it continued for nearly three centuries . Mankind slowly went extinct , our place taken by the supernatural creatures of legends . No one really knows how it started , but it began in Europe . Vampires and Werewolves emerged and began killing and turning everyone they could find . Then came the Fomor , the Seelie and Unseelie , and all the other Gloaming creatures . By the end , every human had been turned or killed , except one . I was kept as a science experiment by one of the vampire lords , a man named Kristoff , who continually subjected me to new methods of turning me . He was actually pretty chill about the whole thing , going out of his way to make sure that I was n't harmed by his experiments . "
" Kristoff had enemies though , and eventually he was killed , his household liberated . Thinking I was one of his house , I was cast out into the world , the last human left . Finding a job was easy , since the majority of the new species were nocturnal , jobs that needed to be done throughout the day were in high supply . I work as a solar panel tech , keeping a massive farm of panels working for the Unseelie Court . They could handle the day , but they preferred the night , and they hated iron and steel , meaning it was difficult for them to manage their solar farms . Enter me , their werewolf tech . I 'm not really a werewolf , but it means I get a three day paid vacation every month at the full moon , a vacation I use to go fishing . "
" The Unseelie are actually pretty great bosses , definitely misrepresented in human literature . They have a ton of rules , and they apply to workers , meaning I get paid excellently and I have a great benefits package . My doctor , working with patient confidentiality , knows I am human , and helps me manage . He files reports saying I 'm a werewolf and he 's been super helpful getting me meals that are balanced , sneaking me supplements to assist my meat-filled diet . Basically , he 's my rock . Fortunately for me , he 's a Elder Fae , and is more immortal than I am , so I do n't have to worry about a new doctor every hundred years or so . "
" He 's been fascinated by my genome , just like Kristoff was , and I do my best to make sure he has lots of samples . I figure keeping him happy is the least I can do . As the world 's oldest and only human , I keep my head down and watch as the world changes . When the Upheaval first happened , the technology level dropped significantly , until the supernatural creatures began to understand humanity 's technology . Now , my Fae doctor takes MRIs , uses 3D Holo Matrices to plot my genome , and does scans using long wave light scans . Not only did the supernatural creatures understand our technology , they also resumed our expansion . Now , nearly 1400 years later , the Earth is a utopia , each race well-represented and well-treated . As a human born in the the late 1900s , I wake up every day fascinated by how the world has changed . Floating cities , space travel , and even flying cars , have now become the norm . "
" All in all then , this world 's not so bad . I make a good living , I have lots of friends , and I recently started seeing an Unseelie Fae , a girl named Mashian , who 's even older than I am . I 've even been thinking of sharing my secret with her , so hopefully she 's okay dating a human . Anyway , that 's life in 1358 A.U . It 's different that I expected when I was a kid , but it 's not bad . Not bad at all .
Safirameal chuckeld to himself . Finally someone had fallen for his act ! Tobias-14 was as gullible and naive as a demon could wish for . "
 <newline> Tobias-14 : And it wo n't hurt ? For real ? 
" <newline> Safi-boy : Of course not . And if it does , we can stop anytime you want . "
 <newline> Tobias-14 : I 've never done it before ... 
 <newline> Safi-boy : But lots of cool boys your age have . They just do n't talk about it . Ever . Do n't you want to be cool ? 
 <newline> Tobias-14 : I am cool . Fine . let 's do it . 
 
 Safirameal could n't believe his luck . A children 's soul and body ! Without any constraints on the possession ! Insane ! 
 <newline> Safi-boy : Just put your hands on the screen and relax . Let me inside .

 <newline> Blank . 
 <newline> Nothingness . 
 <newline> Safirameal screamed into the blackness as he fell and fell and fell ... 
 <newline> Nothing . No evil . No good . 
 <newline> In his room Tobias opened the now black eyes . `` Aah . '' his voice reverberated and growled with strange echoes and feedbacks . His eyes strayed to Mr.Meowzer . The corpse lay rotting in a corner . Tobias had wanted to know what was inside the feline body . Now the demon inside him felt glee at the side and so felt Tobias . He smiled `` So this is how it feels to feel '' 
" <newline> He turned to his window . Lots of world out there . So much to do ...
The armored knight raised his broad sword above his head , his equally broad shoulders squared on his target . His right hand clenched like a vice grip on the hilt with his left holding with slightly less force . He understood that this judgment must be the first and last blow , lest he be butchered by his opponent 's swift blades . "
" `` This will be your only warning traitor ! To your knees or I will strike you down so further below this mud that you may never rise again ! '' The sound of his heart beat drained out the rain , worried his words would tremble he had squeezed the hilt even tighter . "
" `` Your hubris will be your end Edward . No matter your strength or your armor you will never strike me nor will the edge of my steel fail to taste your blood ! '' Leather was all that covered this soldier 's body , weighing him down slightly as it held the rain . His long black hair matted against his face , concealing all the shared traits of the two swordsmen but their sapphire eyes . "
" Once brothers in arms , these two were far passed reconciliation . Charles was irredeemable in his twin 's eyes , his twin short swords had consumed their father 's blood . Edward having given up his royal title , swore an oath to guard the King with his life . He had believed he was the better swordsman , and for that he should protect his brothers . It would allow Charles to take the kingdom , and while they may have shared the same eyes , Charles did not share the same sentiments . "
" Edward 's oath kept him beside their father at all times . Even during the war , when the kingdom 's two greatest swordsmen were expected to lead the fight . The upcoming battle would have their brethren face an army of over ten thousand slaves . Themselves only half the size , Charles knew that alone he would perish much like his fellow soldiers . Without his brother at his side , Charles ' skill in attack would remain uncomplemented and open to retaliation . Charles would become a prize target , with only a small shield in Ethan . Charles is death would leave Edward 's oath null , returning his rights as heir . "
" Before any of this Charles had already shown his dissent . Their father was mad with rage at the foreign army 's refusal . The foreign army had shown no desire to take their kingdom , but required passage through their lands to reach the far west . The King , having heard of their coming , sent a minor brigade to refuse them passage without toll and fealty to the King 's right of dominion . "
" The foreign army slaughtered the brigade , having interpreted the group of knights as a threat . They would send their own messengers to the King , carrying the heads of his knights . The foreign army would not acknowledge the King , but granted him mercy . They would pass through without disruption , as long as the messengers returned to them by the following nightfall . If they did not return , the foreign army was prepared to annihilate the King and his people . "
" Edward kept his opinions to himself , while Charles expressed distaste in his father 's choice to send the brigade in the first place . He warned his father that it would only end in trouble , and to allow the foreign army passage without interruption . Aware of the foreign army 's capabilities , as heard through the various rumors , Charles knew lives would be saved if they avoided a confrontation . Nevertheless , the King 's arrogance would not allow the foreign army to waltz through his domain without a showing of subservience . "
" Their father was mad , ignorant , and cared naught for the people in these final years . When their father called for the messengers heads Charles protested while Edward quietly observed . The messengers did not plead for their lives , but merely said , `` The Prince is wise . His actions will save the lives of your people . Yours would erase your existence from history . No *true* King fails to grace the pages of history . '' Moments later the King would have Ethan take their heads and add them to the pile they brought . "
" Soon thereafter , Edward took his oath and relinquished his title without any consultation . Charles could not fathom his actions . The King had planned to send nearly their entire army to their deaths , including his sons , and his brother would abandon him like a coward . Charles ' disgust with Edward would soon turn to hatred . "
" Whispers claimed that Edward had sent the lieutenant from his personal guard to the foreigners . He would carry an offer of fealty to the foreign Emperor , once they had massacred his brothers and remaining soldiers , in return for sparing the remaining Kingdom under his own name . The whispers came from the torture of Edward 's lieutenant , after Ethan captured him while the kingdom 's army made their way towards the foreign army . "
" Charles , having learned of this betrayal , would leave Ethan in charge and return to court . `` Father 's madness infects Edward 's blood , '' Charles believed . `` I can not allow this to carry on any further , '' he resolved . Charles would seek to have his father relinquish the crown and thus allow him to attempt peace with the foreign
It was n't supposed to end like this . "
" For years , werewolves and vampires attacked each other for dominance . We each wanted to make sure the other would n't hunt humans down to extinction , extinguishing our food source and damning both species . <newline> Then , we realized it was foolish to waste our time and energy fighting over a resource that was expanding by leaps and bounds . Neither vampire nor werewolf grew to a large extent as a community . The process to bare new members was stressful and did n't always achieve success . Humans , on the other hand , needed no prodding or help to procreate , producing members constantly . "
" That was when it was decided that vampires and werewolves could coexist with little issue . We were immortals who could run our little worlds with resources that we had accrued over centuries . It made life good . It made us weak . <newline> Zombies had been around as long as werewolves and vampires . The walking carrion were of no consequence to us , a runt species that was easily ignored . Early humans dealt with them easily enough that numbers were inconsequential . We 'd even thought that they were extinct for the last two centuries . "
" Life became easier for humans . Their numbers swelled to seven billion . Seven billion plump cattle , comfortable to the point of ignorance . Our numbers were so manageable and their lives so disposable , it was a veritable paradise . We became idle . "
" The zombies , whom we thought were distant memories , took advantage of the same population boom and oblivious society that we were also guilty of . They started to spring up in population centers . We thought that the humans would take care of the issue themselves , they had made who knows how many movies about them , how could they not figure out how to put down the issue ? They failed , just as we did . We were more than capable of snuffing it out early on . Our hubris was another contributing factor to our downfall . "
" Now , humanity is gone , the buffet is closed . I sit here in this bunker with a singular werewolf . She is weak . She has not fed in weeks . Many of her kin have destroyed themselves , much like mine did , rather than face starvation . I could have done the same . I wish I had done the same , much like my rigor companion probably wishes . "
" Now , religions touted eternal life as a glorious reward . Our two species have found a way to make it into a damnable punishment . "
" Edit : Spacing
We humans were always interested in finding alien life among the stars . Maybe it was out of curiosity , to see what else laid before us among the stars . Maybe it was out of a fear of being alone in the universe . What ever it was , what ever purpose we had for searching , had led us to this . This was the fate of humanity . "
" I think it is 9:00 , 9:30 ? Who knows what time it currently is , let alone whether it was dusk or dawn . Every time I wake up , I hope that what happened was just a really , really messed up dream , and every time it is the same as the day before . Still shackled to this metal plate , while they pump the blood from my veins to fuel their addictions . Fortunately , I am O+ . That means that they do n't just squeeze me dry and discard my corpse like some sort of twisted version of a capri-sun . But instead , they just take a couple of liters at a time , allowing me to enjoy my misery until I `` expire '' like a carton of milk . Maybe it is because of the rarity of my blood . That 's probably why . They do n't just keep humans alive for this long for no reason . All I know is that my blood is the most potent , the most expensive , the most enjoyable and the most precious blood type in the known galaxy . "
" Sure , it is illegal for them to do this but this place just falls short of the federation 's border . That means any human here is fair game . Or maybe this place is within the border , yet again , lets not get any hopes up . The chances of being rescued is minimal . I try to move into a more comfortable position , yet all this does is cause a sharp pain to ripple through my ribs , signifying that I have triggered the pumps to start doing their job . As my vision starts to clear , I am greeted with the familiar sight of various clear tubes , filled with blood , running out of my abdomen and off to a large pipeline where our blood is sent off to God knows where . "
" Every time I wake up , I do n't say every day as there is no way of telling the time in this place , I turn my head to the left and right to see how my fellow `` cattle '' are doing . And every time I am greeted to the same sight . Columns of people hooked up to this infernal machine , sucking them dry with every passing second . Millions of them , if not thousands , in eternal pain . "
" But something was off . Not as many people where dying and being released into the depths of the facility to be disposed of . Instead , it seemed like the pump was slowing down , as the shooting pain had dulled . The usually high pitched whir of the pump had changed to slow hum . Then a loud crackling came over the loud speaker . <newline> `` Attention , '' stated a commanding voice . It seemed to be coming from every where as there was no source which I could tell the voice was coming from . <newline> `` This is Sergeant Umanda of The Federation . '' <newline> `` This facility is in violation of the `` Extraction Amendment of the Homosapien Species '' and has condemned this facility to destruction . Those who are operating this facility will be incinerated . Anyone who is still alive to hear this , do n't worry . Your suffering will soon come to an end . '' "

Adam and I had a difficult marriage . He desired a demure , obedient little wife . As if . I left his naked ass so fast . So , naturally God - who 's also a man , mind you - declared the marriage null and void . He started again , creating the most beautiful creature I 've ever beheld , notwithstanding the fact she came from that narcissistic ass 's rib . Long red tresses like fire incarnate . Brilliant emerald eyes like deep green pools , pulling me into their abyss . Lovely as the eve she was named for . "
" Too bad she desired to be a dutiful wife . Giving Adam bratty sons , doing as he asked day in and day out . I watched from outside that overrated Garden . Until one day , as luck would have it , she ventured away . That natural curiosity had a way of getting the best of her . I pushed my raven hair behind my ear and stepped out from my place of observation to introduce myself . Naturally she was shocked , having been told it was just herself , Adam , and those ridiculous sons . Overcoming that shock , however , curiosity once more took hold of her . "
" We became fast friends . Every day she would come to see me . Shy at first , the words soon began to cascade from her tongue into my pool of understanding . We became nearly inseparable , and because of this Adam grew suspicious and one day followed her . "
" `` You ! '' he gasped upon seeing me , eyes nearly popping from his head , a vein on his temple fit to burst . "
" `` Me , '' I agreed with a smile pulling at my lips . "
" `` This , this can not stand ! Come , Eve . At once . '' He demanded . "
" `` And if I challenge you for her hand , Adam ? '' I asked , my voice still calm and assured . "
" Adam laughed . `` What ? Impossible . It 's Adam and Eve , not Eve and Lilith . Do n't be crass . '' "
" Casting a sidelong glance at Eve , I replied , `` I mean it . If you can solve my riddle ... I 'll stay away . If not , well , Eve gets to choose . '' "
" Gulping past the thyroid cartilage in his neck that made it look like he 'd swallowed a forbidden apple , he slowly assented with a nod . Ever the self-assured posturer , that one . "
 `` What is harder to catch the faster you run ? '' I asked . Not even a hard one . 
" `` Uh , a snake . Obviously . '' He said , holding out his hand to Eve . `` Come along , '' he said smugly . "
" `` Your breath , is the answer , '' I replied , looking to Eve . With no hesitation , she moved and took my hand . Adam paled and looked near to fainting , but he knew he had lost . "
" Eve and I have been together since , living in our own little garden of bliss . I 've been labeled a demon , of course , but it 's a small price to pay to have that fair creature in my arms . Does n't hurt Adam has turned into an unshaven , self-loathing slob who blames snakes for his misfortunes .
Huo Pao was old and scrawny . He was hardly the right person to appeal to incoming freshmen at the university . The students were sent by their wealthy parents , and some even had advanced tutoring to summon up cantrips . Of course , every guy wanted to learn fire and lightning , but he was loathe to take them on ; they would most likely become tyrants that would need heroes to stamp out . Likewise , they did n't want him . No , they wanted to be taught by loud and proud artillery battlemage , who could conjure great firestorms through excessive channeling of their powers . "
" A pox on them anyway , Huo Pao thought . He was about to exit the hall when he saw a boy . Average height , but unusually fit . Shabby clothes . Very nervous , judging by the jackrabbiting of his right foot . Yet , a nervous person would look around around , trying to both meet a gaze and avert theirs at the same time . "
 This boy was looking at everyone 's magic . 
" `` What do you see , boy ? '' The boy jumped in his seat , startled at the low voice . "
 `` Wh-what ? '' 
 `` I see you looking at their hands . Tell me what you see . '' 
" `` Well ... that guy over there , he weaves his magic like a pen . But I saw him doing the same thing earlier today . He only knows that one move , but he 's good at it . '' "
 `` And ... what about that girl over there ? '' 
" `` I think she already knows some charm magic . There are a ton of guys looking at her , but that did n't happen until she was halfway through the room . You ask me , she 's kinda dumpy . '' "
 `` So what are you so nervous about ? Seems you can already read their magic . '' 
" `` But ... just because I can read it does n't mean I can write it . I 'm just a farmboy who almost burned down the barn over a little scuffle with my pa. Kinda went off like a dragon , but I do n't know how to do it again . '' "
" Huo Pao stroked his chin . Farmboy was certainly different ... and while many farmers had an affinity for earth or water , this boy had fire in his gut . Although many magi may eschew fitness , strong heart and lungs were key to efficient fire evocation , especially if you wanted to skip casting steps . "
" `` You do realize they 've been at this for months , right ? Do n't compare yourself to them yet . '' He realized he forgot something . `` What 's your name ? '' "
" `` My name ? Uh ... Siyo , sir . '' "
" `` Walk up to that instructor over there . Tell him Huo Pao is going to win the bet , then blow your dragon breath on his boots . '' "
 `` But I do n't -- '' 
" `` I know , you could n't do it again ... until now . '' Huo Pao poked him in the solar plexus . `` Heave , but not from your throat . Do it from down here , and project like you want the biggest echo in the valley . Got it ? '' With a nod , the boy got up . After halfway towards the instructor , he looked back ... but his strange trainer was gone . "
 -- -- - 
" A couple days layer , Huo Pao broke the wax seal and opened the parchment . On there was a guild application for one Siyo Son , as well as a sticky note : `` You owe me new boots . '' "
" Huo Pao smiled . The Firebending guild was back in action .
`` Well , what about ... eggs ? '' You suggested with a wince . You were still as averse to the idea of eating them as you had been just this morning , but your ... circumstances ... had changed quite a bit since then . And , well . After having every suggestion of vegetable protein denied -- including soybeans , which you *hated* -- you were getting desperate . Desperate , and very , very *thirsty . * `` I mean , egg albumin is nearly chemically identical to -- '' An exasperated sigh bit through your monologue , bringing about its ' premature end . "
" `` Look . Okay . *Listen* to me , '' Erzabet pinched the bridge of her nose with spidery fingers , her faint Eastern European accent thickening in tandem with her frustration . `` How many ways do you want to hear it from me ? '' She plead . `` The actual , *content* , of what we must consume , is only part of the equation . '' She spread her hands wide , palms up . `` Else why would we bother , with all these modern conveniences -- when we could simply stock a fridge with donated blood -- why still would we go to the hassle of direct feeding ? '' You shrugged weakly . "
" `` Fresh ... tastes ... better ? '' Well , it was true for produce . Unfortunately , you imagined sourcing local O-Positive was a lot more difficult than organic kale . The ancient , supernatural , otherworldly woman -- currently slouched beside you in a pair of your old sweats and an oversized Spinal Tap T-shirt -- grinned ferally , her just-a-bit-too-sharp teeth barely pressing against her lips . "
" `` Oh , do n't get me wrong -- fresh tastes much , *much* better , '' she rumbled , and , fuck , you could feel your body reacting to that in a way that had *gotten you into this mess in the first place , keep your pants on damn it* . Then she sighed , expression shifting from seductive to tired so quickly you wondered if you had n't just imagined it . Shit , did vampires actually have some sort of hypnosis ? "
" `` But no . You see , while we *do* need the actual substance of the blood to replenish our bodies , '' she began , running her fingers over her cheek , newly flushed with stolen blood -- *your* blood , `` it is the actual *act* of taking liquid life from another being that refreshes the magic of our existence : the spell that maintains our immortal forms , '' she explained . You stared at her . "
" `` Uh . Magic ? '' She merely raised a single eyebrow to your incredulous expression , and , okay , yeah , you deserved that . You had pretty clearly wandered past science fiction some time ago and had wound up in that embarrassing part of the bookstore that was halfway between bodice-ripper and YA Fantasy . "
 `` Right . Magic . '' You paused . Something had just occurred to you . `` So how does the sex factor in ? '' You blurted . She snickered . 
" `` Was that not also 'magic ' ? '' she asked . You rolled your eyes , but could n't help the embarrassed flush you felt crawling up your neck . "
" You wondered how long you 'd be able to blush , now , before you needed to ... refill the tank , so to speak . As if sensing your shift in mood , Erzabet also sobered a little . "
" `` It is ... an exchange , '' she said softly . `` Another type of life-ritual . We take the blood , the life-force , to sustain ourselves , and in return , we offer sex , pleasure . Sex is an act of creation , potential life , and rejuvenation of the soul : so when one is traded for the other , neither loses , yet both gain . '' "
" TBC ... ?
It had been called the silent planet once but now , most days , it screamed . "
" Not literally of course but stand above a chorus of a billion souls and the noise is more than enough to drown out most anything . It makes for a very noisy and sleepless occupation , one that I am *soooo* honored to have in case any of the higher ups are listening to this . "
" Earth 1 , the prime creation . The first and by far the worst that my father ever created . I never quite understood how a race or people so similar in *every* way could find so many different reasons to hate each other so . I never understood how you could so easily diverge into a million different religions when the truth was spoonfed to you by the King of Kings himself . I never understood how you could pour so much of your resources into finding new ways to kill each other . But I did understand why you were truly his children . "
" You see his sight is endless but his attention is not . He 's ever so obsessed with recreating the Magnum Opus that was Earth , so much so that he created nearly endless different instances of earth 's just like your own . He never quite got the formula exactly right another time . So naturally when he left his pursuit of recreation on the back burner of his endless might be turned his attention to you once more . "
" My outpost is a coveted one , its the most important of all in fact . He trusted it to me , his second son , Michael . And though my post is considered to be an immense honor in the armies of Heaven , its reputation did no proceed it . I have watched over the endless carnage that is your society for millennia , and I expected my father to smite you the instant he turned his titanic attention towards you once more . However , almost as if to show me how little I truly understand him , he looked upon your earth and smiled . "
 I never asked why but I think I worked it out . It 's your spirit that he loves . That he chases after . It is one of creation . It is one of endless love . It is one of endless malice . It is one of endless kindness . It is one of endless hate . It is one of power . It is one of weakness . It is one that is all things . It is his . 
" The perfect mirror of the perfect being . Forever beyond his reach , to touch it is to destroy it . To gaze upon it is to know the sorrow of the creator . It is why he seeks to recreate it . It is his perfection incarnate . After all you were made in his image . "
" So when he turned his attention to you once more after all these millennia , all he did was look upon you . His face that is not a face held immense sadness . All he did was look and for an instant I saw in you what he does . I saw him . "
" So I turned my eyes to the silent planet once more and the sounds that escaped it were no longer screams , but rather calls of joy . As if you knew your perfection , as if you knew just what it is that you were the perfect emulation of . I took to my post once more and I looked not upon the mewling faces of the savages but upon the visage of God himself .
I kicked off my gym shoes as I walked into my apartment . My entire body ached from the day . What time was it ? Late enough to be pitch black outside . God , I could use a whole body massage right now . "
" I fell into the couch and stretched out , feeling each muscle tense up , from my torso to my calves , and then relax . I breathed out audibly . Today ’ s training had been the toughest yet - a relentless cycle of pounding the punching bag , hours in the ring , and shooting drills . Mark , my trainer , had been more determined than ever to train , but I had also sensed his underlying , quiet distress throughout the day . "
" The doorbell rang suddenly , startling me . I got up quietly from the couch and peered through the peephole . There was a woman standing there , with long red hair and thick framed glasses , looking down the hallway . She looked vaguely familiar somehow , but I couldn ’ t place her . I opened the door tentatively . "
" The woman stood in the doorframe staring at me for a long moment , a knot on her forehead , frowning slightly . <newline> “ Alexa ? Is that really you ? Alexa Goodman ? ” she had an untraceable accent . <newline> “ That ’ s my name . Can I help you with something ? ” <newline> The woman ’ s face brightened , her expression now ecstatic . “ Wow , I can ’ t believe it ! I mean , I can not believe I ’ m really seeing you in the flesh ! You look just how I imagined , though maybe a little shorter than I would have thought… ” The woman took a step closer , head cocked , as if inspecting me . "
 “ I ’ m sorry - am I missing something ? Do I know you ? ” 
" The woman laughed . “ I ’ m Rachel . Do you mind if I come inside ? This is might take a while. ” Rachel ’ s hands were clasped together against her chest , practically shaking . "
" Who the hell was this woman ? A sociopath ? Or worse , a salesperson ? I would normally have shooed a stranger like her away , but curiosity got the better of me - how did she know me ? Why was she so oddly familiar ? "
" “ Okay , come on in . Make yourself comfortable. ” I laid myself on the couch . "
 The woman trailed quietly behind me and sat uncomfortably close to me . Letting her in was probably a mistake . 
 “ So… how exactly do you know me ? Are you a long lost relative or something ? ” 
" “ Well , not exactly , ” Rachel smiled uneasily . “ How do I say this without freaking you out ? ” "
" “ You ’ ve done a pretty good job freaking me out already , I ’ m sure I can handle whatever you have to say. ” "
" “ Alexa , I just want you to know that you are my favorite book character , and I know how it ends and I want to help change it. ” Her words ran out quickly , like a river . "
" I paused for a moment , confused . “ Come again ? ” "
 “ You ’ re one of the main characters in the Manhunt series . You have a mission tomorrow. ” 
 “ I do ? ” 
" “ Yes ! But it ’ s a suicide mission , ” Rachel ’ s eyes opened wide . “ You can ’ t go ! I mean , I can ’ t believe that he would kill you off , you are by far the most well developed character… So. ” Rachel looked directly in my eyes . “ You can ’ t go. ” "
" Silence filled the room . I didn ’ t want to believe her , but the idea that I was a character , a pawn in someone ’ s fucked up story , was beginning to make a lot of sense to me . All of the coincidences that happened in my life that were too good to be true , the times when something external deep within me changed my motives last minute , all of the strangely predictable twists of fate - they all were contrived , created . And I was going to be killed off , just for the sake of a plotline . Rachel ’ s voice interrupted my thoughts . "
" “ Here ’ s my proposition to you . I can rewrite your story , with you as the protagonist , the heroine . I ’ ve got all the details here in a contract… all you have to do is sign. ” Rachel pulled a large piece of parchment out of nowhere . “ Do you have a pen ? ” she asked . "
" “ Yes , in my bedroom . Let me go get it. ” I bought myself some time , a moment for myself . "
" I walked into my bedroom , shut the door , and paced . My mind was racing . All at once , the solution became clear . I grabbed the shotgun I kept in my bedside drawer and walked out to Rachel , barrel pointed at her face . "
" “ I don ’ t need anyone to write my story , bitch . ”
Everyone has experience a `` last straw '' moment . "
" This kid at work was the worst . I 'm 23 , he 's 26 , he acts like he 's an immature 11-year-old . "
" We started out friendly . I would laugh at his jokes , I would humor him when he wanted to show me a youtube video . Then he started to try to show me porn at work , he started to boss me around even as it became evident I was already a better worker than he was . He bumped me when I was holding a knife a few times , I got small cuts . "
 I complained to management and they did nothing . I was starting to realize the type of place I worked for . He starts spraying me with the hose at night when we are cleaning up . After we close he follows me to my car and I have a hard time getting him to leave me alone so I can head home . 
 Days later he starts following me part of the way home . I was getting paranoid . 
" I asked for a few days off from work , I could n't sleep at night , I was so angry at this guy , I wanted him to disappear off the face of the earth so badly . "
" I came back to work and there he was , joking around , blasting his anime music all shift long , doing it in front of the customers . Nobody would miss this guy if he was gone . Then I hatched my plan . "
" Next time he followed me home I would turn off my lights and sneak off and stop . Then I would wait for him to pass me , and slowly follow him from a distance for a while . "
" As he passed the hill right by the electrical plant I rammed him off the road right into the worst of it , sparks flew , I did n't see any movement and I drove off . I heard an explosion soon after and I felt no remorse . "
 When I got home I changed the tread on my tires and burned the old ones until there was nothing left . 
 In the news I read a story about a young man who tends to drink during his shifts at work and crashed into the electric plant by the hill . Evidence of alcohol containers were found in his car . 
" I started to like the feeling of having this guy out of my life for good . I liked knowing I ended him . Soon after our store closed ( it was the crappiest store around ) , I decided to enlist .

" Ah , here is a very curious subgroup of the human species , the northern american . It walks along the designated 'concrete ' : a primitive form of infrastructure , composed mainly of water and sand . The human navigates as best he can , narrowly avoiding other humans and occasionally bumping in to one , not unlike the flightless one-eyed Yipps on planet Voranus . "
 It enters a structure through glass panels and engages with another human at an arrangement of wood and marble . A transaction is made .

" <newline> Nobody knows why the numbers started dropping . It was n't noticeable at first , there were 9.6 billion people in the year 2051 after all . However , once people started dropping like flies , the world wide database started to pick up a trend . "
" One the numbers started dropping , everyone was given a wristband that connects to them intravenously . It monitors their heartbeat , can show GPS location , and can be scanned for identification purposes . Once it stops detecting a pulse , Once the population began to rapidly decrease , the live number became public domain and was released on the internet . <newline> I checked it every day on my smartwatch . "
" We never did figure out the cause of death , just that they died . My name is Adam . My wife and I , Evelyn , are the only humans left on Earth . "
" We felt alone well before I watched the population count on my watch hit two . The other survivors were miles away , probably in different countries . However , seeing that number was like a pin being dropped . We were the only ones left . <newline> Delirium set in next . Can you imagine the pain of losing everyone you 've ever known ? At least the dead do n't have the means to realise everything is gone , they know peace . However , the will to survive , that primal instinct to exist , is strong . We never came to accept it , but we learned to live with it . "
" Eighteen months passed . I still checked the population on my watch several times a day out of some sense of hope . It always remained at two . We figured out a simple way of living , even if continuing to live felt pointless . I wished I knew why we were chosen , why we were left to wander the earth as living ghosts whilst everybody else moved on . Was it a rapture ? No , surely we could n't be the only people unworthy of Heaven - and it would be narcissistic to suggest we were the only people worthy of it . "
" One night , I heard Evelyn sobbing during the night . Alarmed , I awoke and rolled over to face her . Her words pierced the darkness and stopped the breath in my throat . "
 `` I 'm pregnant . '' 
" We stayed up all night , not sure how to feel . A couple of years ago I would have been overcome with joy to hear I was going to become a father . All I felt was dread and uncertainty . How could I bring a child up in a world like this ? How could I protect my baby from becoming sick ? All the doctors died , basic medical aid was as far as I could stretch . What if there were complications with the birth ? Despite my own doubts , I had to be strong for Evelyn . I had to be our rock . "
" One day , almost nine months later , I was forced to confront my fears . I tried my best to console Evelyn , she was in agony for eight hours . By the time her labour was through , I had looked into my daughter 's eyes for the first time . She was here . Unfortunately , bringing her into this world had cost Eveyln everything . She gave her own life so that our baby could live . "
" I could not bear to see the number 'one ' staring at me from my watch screen . Struggling to see through tears , I removed Evelyn 's wristband and attached it to my daughter . "
 I checked my watch . It had gone back to displaying the number two . 
" -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - <newline> Before she died , Evelyn had named our daughter Morana . I tried my best not to blame her for her Mother 's death , but sometimes it was hard . I 'd look into her eyes and see Evelyn . I 'd see a stolen life . I wanted to love her so badly , but I could not see past my resentment , even though I knew deep down it was not her fault . "
" The thing is with no one being around on Earth is that you can just walk into places and take what you want . I took to drinking bottles of whisky from the abandoned supermarkets . Some days I would drink so much I 'd wake up with no recollection of the night before , not even remembering if I 'd fed Morana , or put her to bed . One particular day I woke up with a nasty hangover . I wiped the sleep from my eyes and felt something wet smear across my cheek . I stared at my hands in shock ... they were caked in red . I looked at the number on my watch and the grim reality slapped me in the face . "

The men laughed as the little girl emerged from behind the city gates . "

" `` I did , '' she replied , drawing her knife . `` I called on my Father in Heaven . And He will grant me victory on this day , if you do not turn around and go back to from whence you came . '' "
" One man grabbed a sword and stepped forward , roaring , `` Enough of this ! This little girl taunts us ! '' "
" He approached her , but she approached him even more swiftly , and slew him with the knife . "
" Three more men approached and were too slain . City watchers saw this from the gate , and the little girl 's fearless display excited them to call all the soldiers .

" After the accident , I had assumed that this would fade . I crashed my car into a truck and ripped the nerves from my spinal cord . I know all this . Technically , the arm is still there , and I haven ’ t lost it at all . They left it so they could try to graft nerves to the spine , and for hope , really . Seemingly unaware that I know all this , my mind constantly cycles through the realisation ( Where is my arm ? ) and reminder ( It ’ s gone ) and acceptance ( Oh , okay ) .

Almost always , I write without an outline . However , a couple times , I 've used a very vague `` tentpole method '' outline -- as in , I 've got a couple ideas that lead up to a conclusion . For example , when I wrote my NaNoWriMo novel last November , I wrote out three `` tentpoles '' which were the beginning , middle , and end of my story , at about a paragraph each . I have another one which is doing the same thing , but in terms of three books of 40k each ( a paragraph each ) . "
" For everything else I 've written though , it 's off the top of my head . Sometimes I do n't even have a proper ending in mind , just maybe a couple ideas I 'd love to toss in . A lot of people love serious outlines , but I end up going `` why do an outline when I can just write the book ?

They would n't have even made contact with us if it were n't for the radio transmissions . Not the news bulletins or the misguided attempts at interplanetary communication , no , they just interpreted those as signs that we should be left alone . When their hundred-mile-long ark arrived in our skies no one could believe it . They claimed that their ship was capable of near-light speed , but even then the trip from Tau Ceti had taken fifteen years . "
" What we learned about their society was fascinating : Although much of the Milky Way could be considered a single civilization , as knowledge and ideas were freely shared amongst planets , the individual worlds still largely kept to themselves due to the immense distances involved . Interstellar travel was exceedingly rare and only used sparingly . In addition , the standard procedure for the past few million years had been to monitor civilizations from afar until they were advanced enough to establish communication . Once they were contacted they would have to prove themselves worthy of membership in the Galactic Union , which would grant them access to all knowledge shared by the other planets as well as ability to travel freely across the galaxy ( if they felt the need to do so ) . They also became galactic ambassadors tasked with admitting any future planets closest to them . So far seventy-three planets had joined , all but the first few in the same manner . We , on the other hand , were n't advancing fast enough and were deemed worthy of an immediate in-person meeting . As it turns out , we humans are the artisans of the galaxy . "
" All of the intelligent civilizations yet discovered had the capacity for wonder , humor , and storytelling , but none came close to human creativity . Apparently our radio shows , music , television , and movies had been passed around the galaxy as fast as radio waves would allow . Scholars continue to argue whether this is due to our capacity for lies or our fascination with conflict , but the fact remains that even the worst human art and entertainment is a masterpiece to the rest of the galaxy . "
" The beings from Tau Ceti were n't even the ones who should have been tasked with admitting us to the Union , but they had the misfortune of evolving an enormous appetite for entertainment with almost no skills at producing it . The promise of even more forms of art and entertainment that had n't been broadcast into space was too much , and they organized an expedition to Earth . Approximately two million of them arrived on the ark , all willing to leave their normal lives for a chance at experiencing human entertainment first-person . Their first message to us after we detected them in orbit was the musical notes from *Close Encounters* . "
" We were given tests and failed miserably at almost all of them . Not only were we not ready to join the rest of the galaxy , the results indicated that we would likely never be ready . Fortunately for us , they discovered our art museums , books , live theater , and the Internet , in addition to the vast amount of music , movies , and television that had never been broadcast into space . They had been experiencing so little of what we had to offer that we were immediately granted limited member status in the Galactic Union . They shared all of their knowledge in exchange for rebroadcasting rights for existing works , and any artist or entertainer who wished to travel the galaxy was guaranteed a life of luxury . To this day , no matter which planet you are on , the humans working in the arts and entertainment industry are among the most respected and wealthy . "

Twice every suncycle , I walk around my dusty , one-room shop , and chant the ancient prayers of Shib'aal . The words flow out of me like running water , but I had no idea what they meant - all my knowledge was like the person who 'd learn to speak dolphinese by imitating the dolphins . Carefully , I pace - seven times clockwise , seven times anticlockwise - for seven is the multiplicity of the Ringworld . This *has* to be done . Otherwise , or so the legends said - otherwise the Ringworld would fragment , be torn apart under the stress of its rotation . This is my typical day - but I 'm somewhat helped by the fact that this is n't your typical shop . You see , in here I sell prayers for the dead . "
" No-one knows how we came to be on this megastructure . Some ancient species had decided to build this monstrous ring , a hundred and fifty million klicks in diameter , and we were all that was left of their ambitious project . We have no history , save for the history that we made ourselves . We are the nameless , faceless inhabitants of infinity - we do not come from anywhere , nor do we go anywhere once we leave . For this reason folks here are rather pessimistic about death . In the best of times it was nothing to shout about , but here on the Ringworld death was positively mortifying , if you 'll pardon the pun - because there was no certainty whether or not the universe would carry on without you . I mean , from what we 'd seen , it 'd always kept trucking along - but realising this would require people to admit that they were not the center of their own universe . Of course , this has since been empirically proven to be a stupidly difficult thing to shake off . "
" When my prayers are done I look outside the window . There 's not much breathable air outside , but it 's still enough to give the world a thin blue veneer . Far off in the distance , I can see the other half of the ringworld , stretching across the sky like some movie reel drawn in space . Soon the first few customers would walk in . A childless mother , perhaps . Or a broken partner . A dying man . Death was a booming business here , and if one were inclined only to money , you 'd definitely say this was Pluto 's lot - the gemstones and the underworld . Running this place , and seeing the people that passed through this place , meant that every passing day could never be fully typical . This place was routine only in its unroutine-ness . "
" I heard the bell tinkle and tried to look suitably sad . A mother approached the counter , her face wrinkled , her eyes red . Out of the corner of my eyes , I could see a small gold band on her fingers . Something inside my soul stirred - it is as if I had seen her before . Had I really ? "
 `` I 'm sorry for your loss . How may I help you today ? '' I intoned . 
" `` One extra-strength prayer tablet , please , '' she said . "
" I dived behind the counter , where I saw a tiny , pinkish pellet on one of the shelves . Carefully , I extracted it from where it rested and passed it across the counter . `` I 'm sorry , who is this for ? '' I asked . "
" She looked at me , and for the first time , I saw a look of surprise sweep her weathered face . "
 `` Do n't you remember me ? '' she asked . 
" I looked at her , and suddenly it was as if an electric bolt had run down my spine . "
 `` Nancy ? '' I asked in disbelief . 
 The woman only nodded . `` Once we went to the city . I remembered it well - there were seven bridges connecting the island and the bank . We tried to cross all of them and come back to the same spot . Always we tried - always we failed . '' 
" `` Nancy , '' I simply repeated . The prayer tablet rested silently on the counter top . This was n't unusual - a lot of people on the Ringworld , even the shadowy figures that dominated the other side - they all knew me . But Nancy was special . "
" `` It was a prophecy , '' I said . `` Only the lovers who cross 'd the seven would be joined together in heaven . We never did cross them together , Nancy - so I suppose- '' "
" Nancy swallowed . And then , in a flash , I understood . The ring on her finger- "
 `` You married ? '' I asked . `` Despite our promise not to ? '' 
 Nancy nodded . She could n't bear to tell me the horrible truth - the idea that love could hurt was too much to contemplate . 
 `` Who is your husband ? '' I asked . 
" `` He 's dead , '' she replied . `` I 'm buying this prayer for him . I have nothing left in the ringworld , except my wedding ring - will you be willing to accept that as payment ? '' "
" It was not a matter of payment at all , and
`` What ? '' "
" `` Its a computer program . All of this . Our life , our world , all of it . A damn computer program ! '' "

" `` So , what ? We are n't real ? We 're just a.. Computer program ? Do you honestly think I 'd believe that ? '' "
" `` It does n't matter what you believe , the datas right there . '' "
 `` OK. Say we are A.I.s in a computer program . Why would they give us enough intelligence to realise what this is ? ''

" The Coloplfian cackled slightly over the squad channel , “ When can we get some burritos ? I ’ m starving. ” "
" Sergeant Renfro sighed , “ I do n't think the locals have them , Tiv . You can sample the fare *after* we 're done. ” "
" A large “ 10 ” appeared centimeters from his face . It faded into a “ 9 ” . *You know , sometimes I wish they ’ d just drop us rather than have the buildup of a count d–* "
" The acceleration of the drop cut him off . In the pods they were in zero g , free from artificial gravity . Upon launch , the systems did their best to create a limiting field effect around them . It cut the g forces to ten percent , but it still kicked like a mule . After a few moments , acceleration gave way to stabilized flight . "
" Gregori could feel the adjustment thrusters nudging the pod . Gently at first , the tug of gravity returned . Then the shuddering began , followed the main thrusters kicking in forcing them into an accelerated burn . "
 *Two seconds and…* 
" With a pop , bang , and a hiss the drop-pod broke into four tear shaped meteors , shedding a good deal of debris into the air behind them . "
" *Another three seconds…Need some music . Computer , play : * Atreyu-Doomsday . *Medium Volume , Auto-fade for incoming communications . * Gregori had taken a few liberties with regulations and coded into his suit a basic music emulator , but ensured that it would not interfere with his situational awareness by coding it in a manner that allowed the audio systems of the suit to override it under specific circumstances . "
" The speakers near his head began to build up a crescendo of throbbing guitars , just as the air around him exploded . Scattering behind him , the protective shell that held him flew away . Thin wisps of clouds buffeted him as he plummeted . He checked his readouts . Everyone was still green , everyone was now in free-fall . "

The winding road extends before me like the body of a snake . Rain pounds the windshield , and I drive at a crawling pace lest the serpent wake and fling me from its back . "
" On one side of the serpent , a steep hillside , covered in shadow , brush , and trees . On the other side , a sheer cliff extending down to the ocean . Who knows what foul creatures lurk in the dark waters at the base of the cliff . The road is perilously lodged between two extremes-the trees which reach up impossibly high to tickle the feet of God , and the ocean which flows down into the depths of the earth to cool the fires of Hell . "
" I look over at the passenger seat . My beautiful wife sits there , the side of her face pressed to the window . She was fast asleep , lulled by the sound of the rain and the hum of the tires on the wet pavement . I sigh . I am bitter . "
" We are returning home from her parents ' place . A dry roast dinner had been a poor distraction from the equally dry conversation . But , there at the chipped yellow Formica table , under flickering florescent lights , my wife , my 'beautiful ' wife , had confessed to everything . I wish she had n't . "
" Affairs . Drug use . Theft , to support both her habits and her boyfriends ' . She talked for what seemed like hours about her sins , though it was only minutes . I know , now , that while she might have her head turned to the hillside that reaches up , she is forever suspended over the cold , watery precipice . I realize that I 've picked up speed . "
" I jerk the steering wheel . Not enough to cause an accident or to wake her . Just enough to prove to myself I could . I reach over and shake her awake . She looks at me , not speaking , only lifting that questioning brow of hers . I jerk the wheel again , and her eyes widen in panic . "
" I turn the wheel sharply , veering towards the cliffside . She does n't scream , only grips the dashboard as the car tires leave the pavement . For a few wonderful moments , we are suspended in midair . Gravity has no power over us-we are flying . Angels , for the first and last time , before time resumes and we plummet towards the ocean . "
" The roaring of the waves growing louder , I spare a glance into the back seat . There , our child , a boy of seven , is fast asleep , his head having fallen onto his chest . I smiled . "
" I wanted my wife to know , but my son , if he is mine ... he wo n't know what happens tonight .
He scratched the back of his neck as he yelled to his wife , `` Honey ! Where did I put my keys ? '' He was always losing his damn keys , but they always seemed to be in the same place . Either in his coat pocket or on the table . One thing was for sure , his wife would always know exactly where they were . "
 `` They 're on the table in the foyer '' She yelled from the nursery . 
" Of course , there they were . On his drive to work , he thought about the issues of the day and how they would affect his family . Ever since the breakthrough government system that was implemented ten years ago , things have never been better . Crime rates were down and as a result , the number of prisons that have closed is amazing . People are being treated for mental illnesses and not just thrown in an environment where they wo n't get help . The government has never been more productive . He rubbed the back of his neck as he felt the small bump . He knew it was a neural implant , ca n't remember what it does . Suddenly , he remembered the Royals were doing pretty well this year and it would be cool if they won the crown . They had done fairly well the previous year and have a pretty good chance . "
" He arrived at work and went to his cubical . Although it was fairly early , his coworkers all arrived by 7:30 . Just like every day . After he put his black leather briefcase down , he made his rounds to catch up with everyone . He noticed everyone else had bumps too ; on the back of the neck , just above the spine . Why does everyone have these implants again ? What are they for ? Damn , the weather has been great this weekend . He returned to his desk and got to work . "
" Something kept bothering him though . Everything he said , everyone agreed with . Whether it be political views , who should win the Super Bowl , or even favorite foods . Every time he would think about it he would suddenly get distracted . "
" But still , life was good and the government is on his side . "
 Just like everyone else .

He did n't know who he was supposed to be this time . The landscape around him was green and full of tropical trees . The ground was muddy , the wind blew hard , and in the far distance he could see a river . He could hear trumpets , he could hear roaring , but only softly so . Nobody was around him , though he wore heavy armour along with a sword and shield , as well as a helmet . A lone warrior was an uncommon thing . He placed his hand on the helmet . Phrygian ? He guessed he was in a battle , but he could n't see the men around him . Sometimes he thought he saw faint ghastly visions of a magnificant army with grand pikes marching past him , but they were n't real , just figments of his imagination . "
" Across him was an Indian . He marched confidently , but without as much armour . India ? He looked at his hands . White as could be . Odd . "
" He marched forwards as well , but then stopped . He did n't know why he had marched forward or stopped . The Indian stopped as well , but after a short pause he roared and charged at him . He could hear orders being faintly shouted and the sound of a massive stampede coming towards him . "
" The Indian charged blindly , without much sense . As the Indian warrior was about to crash into him , he lifted his shield to prevent himself from being knocked over and buried his sword in the Indian 's stomach . "
" The landscape disappeared . Time for the next one . So many..
The Powerball was up to 10 million . The country was in rough shape with overpopulation and the power of the dollar was failing . Everyone looked at their tickets with hope they will be able to see a better tomorrow . The numbers started to be called off . "
 The announcer was dressed in so many rhinestones it was like the earth gave him a lap dance and transferred all it 's glitter to his suit . He was smiling with perfect white teeth . 
" `` Greetings winners ! Tonight is June 23rd , 2031 and people will have their lives changed by the end of this ! The first number is 10 ! 23 ! .. '' "
 One guy with a grey fringed mustache got excited and started whooping and hollering . Fuck him . 
" `` The next number is 37 , 45 and with a Powerball of 4 ! The numbers again are 10 , 23 , 37 , 45 and Powerball 4 ! '' "
 God fucking dammit .

 Five other phones were also blinking in the place .

Someone had covered her with a blanket and taken off her shoes . Rob ’ s room , yes . He was already gone , probably off on a morning walk . His bracelet sat on the desk , inches from her face , glowing faintly . So he wasn ’ t close . Maybe at the gym , or getting coffee , but it didn ’ t matter . Emma watched the red light slowly grow brighter . Quietly , with a sense of peace , she removed her own bracelet , dull gray as always , and left it on the desk . On her own wrist she slipped Rob ’ s bracelet , and as it began to grow brighter , she straightened the bedcovers and left . * <newline>
Every time I turn around I see so much that should piss me off , and it does , but I 'm just so fucking tired all the time . There 's never a god damn reason to really get up and actually do anything about it . Every good and noble person working for the betterment of us as a species has a dozen people apparently unable to see beyond their own personal fortunes toiling to keep things fucked . Then I see you . You are such a god damn beautiful human being , doing these amazing things and improving the lot of everyone around you . Working twenty hour days every day for months on end and actually achieving good things . Then I look at myself , and holy shit . I 'm so god damned mediocre it is disgusting . I 'm smarter than average , but barely care . I have a good basic body type , but ca n't be bothered to get in shape . I 'm fucking horribly lonely all the time and I ca n't muster up the god damned energy to do anything about it . "
" You show me what I could be , you show me the other option . I love you for it . I want your respect more than anything in the world . And I hate you so much it terrifies me .
`` Well that was n't my brightest moment . '' "
 `` It certainly dwarfed all of your previous mistakes . '' 
 `` I 'm not sure you appreciate the gravity of your new situation . ''

" From the primordial soup of silence to the surging spark of life to the astrophysical abortion , all in the span of a minute ; entropy bled out the momentum of the conversation into the open expanse of the observatory ’ s eggshell dome . Some sad social cousin of alchemy or chemistry produced a faint stench of nerd sweat , the final embarrassed exudate of the odd man out of the odd men within . "
" We all pointedly gazed back into our own private lenses , and poor Marvin was left staring once more into his own personal abyss .
To be fair , I 'm always a little intimidated to talk to any kind of stranger , let alone a girl with long brown hair and deep green eyes and a propensity for wearing low-cut shirts . This feeling is familiar -- my heart is in my throat , the adrenaline is surging , I can barely breathe let alone think let alone keep my throat clear so my voice comes out smooth and even , as if talking to her is just the easiest thing in the world . This is normal . "
" And yet . I 'm sure this time is different . This time she is making me feel the way that I feel , I mean actively sensing that I am looking at her and as a result making my throat close up , my pulse quicken , my palms sweat and my entire theoretical life with her flash before my eyes , punctuated by sex with her , often , forever . She is a God . "
" How else to explain the fact that she has never raised her hand once , or even been called on to speak , despite sitting right there in the front , close to the door . How else to reconcile the fact that not even the football player , who comes into this class to take the exams and nothing else , tries to hit on her after class as I see all other football players in all my other classes do to all the other beautiful girls ? How else can it be that this person is so incredibly gorgeous , and is not already married and living in a castle somewhere , whisked away by a handsome actor with a trust fund ? She is unreal . She is too good to be true . She is unapproachable , especially by the likes of me , and she knows it , and she wants me to know that she knows it . She knows I have figured her out and she is trying to put me off , like she does with everyone else . "
" But : It 's the last day of class . We will hand in a paper next week to complete our coursework . We will no longer sit here and discuss the differences between Sikhism and Buddhism , or parse through Masuzawa 's texts . We will go home and pretend this never happened , most likely -- happy to have passed and to move on . But for me , this class wo n't end until I talk to her , and find out if she 's real . I will not be dissuaded . "
" The time has come . The clock has struck noon and the professor has dismissed us . We rise , more or less in unison , gathering our things and nodding silently at each other or ignoring the world . I see her already moving towards the door , and through it , and out into the hallway . "
" I race out to find her , and see her hair disappearing down the stairwell . My feet feel heavy as I clomp after her . My body has not yet caught up with my brain and refuses to believe we are trying to move this quickly in this direction . I want to call out , but not only does my mouth fail to work , I do n't even know her name . "
" I round into the grey stairwell and see her a flight below , almost out of sight . It is truly now or never . "
" Hey , I say , down the stairs at her receding shadow . I say it quietly , but it echoes along the concrete and I see the shadow cease moving . "
" I walk down the stairs and approach her , as she turns to me . "
" Hey , I say again . I realize I have n't planned for this , that I was sure she would disappear in a puff of smoke if I actually reached her . I fumble for the next words . "
 What 'd you think of the class ? I manage to blurt out . 
" She simply smiles and raises an eyebrow . Then she speaks , and the force of her voice pushes me against the wall of my own mind . I am standing stock still and yet blown away to hear the words come out of her mouth . "
" `` It was interesting . Never thought I 'd take a class like that and actually like it . Wan na grab coffee and talk about the final ? '' she says , easy as a hand through fur , as a light beer into the glass . "
" Sure , I say , and put out my hand . I tell her my name , and we walk out of the stairwell and into the sun . "
" `` Nice to meet you . I 'm Tanri . ''

 `` What about Victor ? '' 
" `` Oh , it 's always about Victor with you ! '' He jumps down , his small frame pressing its weight upon the R key . `` Will you let him go already ? Dressing him up over and over again has done nothing for you . He 's only holding you back . '' "
 `` Do n't talk about Victor like that ! At least he respects me . '' 
" `` You do n't get it , do you ? He 's your favorite . Of course he tells you whatever you want him to say . '' He steps on my hand , and I pull it away . `` I 'm telling you what you need to hear . Forget about him . Write a story about me . About only me . '' "

 I stare at him . `` You do n't believe that . ''

`` Oprah ? '' I screech at myself . The nappy , curly , natural black hair shakes with my reflection . This is a joke- one of those syndicated prank shows , where everyone will come out at the end , laughing at me . Laughing , toting Burbank sized cameras , asking me to fill out consent forms to legally exploit my humiliation . Only that does n't happen . There 's a full body mirror in the bathroom when I `` discover '' I 'm Oprah , so I think the best thing for me to do is spread my asscheeks as wide as I can pull them , and look into Oprah 's ass . It 's a once in a lifetime chance that you could be this close to one of the most respected women of all time . Let me take you on a journey- a journey into Oprah 's asshole . "
" As wealthy as you would think one like Oprah to be , you would think that her asshole would be impeccable . When you find a homeless man named Rhonda waiting outside , asking if you would like pleasure for crack , you soon find out that Oprah 's asshole is in fact , a slum . Oprah , being a genius upon our time , takes that slum and turns it into magic . `` Magic Beads '' she calls it . `` I give one TO YOU ! ! ! `` , `` And TO YOU , `` YOU over there look like you ned some magic beads ... ... . '' I GIVE YOU TWO PAIRS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! OMG HLAJKELFDJ ! Everyone is like `` YES ! ! ! ! I love Oprah she gave me anal beads ! ! ! ! Until one fan takes it too far . They sit outside the Oprah recording studio . They accumulate three necklaces of Oprah 's anal beads . They stick one string up , dangling accross the nipples ... fantasizing about Oprah 's unwaxed mustache tickling their nipple ... ..They stick the second string up , up a little to high for comfort , but they will do anything to appease Oprah . The third one- there 's no where to put it anywhere else but anally . Little did Oprah know , or her perverted , obsessed follower know , that the anal beads have been made in a factory in South Korea , where sanitation and health codes are completely disregarded , and now you have AIDS you gross Oprah anal bead fucker .
The Great Halt . That is what they called it . The day that the Earth stood still and from eldest to youngest , powers were received like some sort of divine blessing . I watched the Earth from the ISS , completely bewildered . "
" One by one they chose . The eldest chose traditional powers . The first man to declare `` Flying '' rocketed into the sky at the speed of a bullet , leaving his walker behind . Everyone around him , inspired , chose the same power ( along with millions across the globe ) . They all scrunched up their faces and concertedly rose but 2-3 inches . Just as the choruses of dissatisfaction were raised down plummeted the first flying man like a meteor , his power distributed throughout the world , smashing into the ground like a grasshopper on a windshield . "
" It soon became apparent that the more that a single power is chosen , the weaker it becomes until it is just an insignificant thing . "
" We spent a few days waiting for the chaos to subside before returning to Earth . One step on the surface , and I could feel it . This great warm surge running from my legs to my brain . I knew that I could choose anything , be anything , that I wanted . However , days after The Great Halt , here I stood , a human with an advantage . I knew the rules , and would not be trumped . "
" Just then screaming broke out . I whipped around to find a man robbing a group of people , His right arm made of extendable lava . *Oh , that 's a good one* I thought , admiring his originality . However , my phrasing would leave me the only man in the world with my power . The only man capable of stopping the great and all powerful super villain Magma Stretchy Arm ! "
" Stepping up in all my glory , I declared my power to the heavens . Ripping off my shirt , I mercilessly beat him to death . From that day forward , my name was to be sung on high . Ronald Chen , Master of the Insta-Growing Kung Fu Chest Hair !
*Well , this sorta blew up a bit more than I expected for something I just thought of in the shower before work today . I suppose I 'll have a go at it now that my comment can be buried in my own thread , away from all the scrutiny that is writing criticism . * "

 The first hair hit the ground and everything happened at once . I mean that literally . 
 I hit the `` Slow time '' button on the TimeWatch as the first ninja lunged . His movement slowed to a crawl .

This is what i wrote so far . I did n't realize how long it was until I stopped and read some . If you want me to continue let me know . "
" I never much had a taste for flying . Almost like a long Cuban cigar which I find harsh and unpleasant yet , some love the taste and “ texture ” of the thick smoke rolling off the tongue . Much like flying in a way , some love flying , or just don ’ t mind it , while others loath the very slightest of plane rides . <newline> I myself always find a nervous pit in my stomach form when it comes to booking the tickets , checking the bags , and boarding the flight . That small sudden ping of anxiety the moment the flight attendant fakes the over exaggerated hello and the captain gives his pre-flight speech to prepare the individuals partaking on the flight and giving them all the particulates . Today was no different as I boarded the flight I got the same pang of anxious , stomach churn and took my seat . <newline> 3-B , window seat , I guess I couldn ’ t be upset for I enjoy the flying sensation , staring downward at the miniscule landscape , with that brief understanding of the perspective of god In way , or for those who don ’ t believe in the big omnipotent man upstairs , at least a bird . <newline> 3-B , window seat , for some reason my mind wanted to repeat it as if some form of a sequence , maybe I should have had some more damn coffee this morning waiting at the O ’ Hare lounge . Plus , the barista there was a looker , even though she always seems to get some grounds in your coffee , but nobody is perfect . <newline> Tilting back my tray the flight attendant brought me over the pretzels and prune juice I asked for as I set my travel pillow behind my head . Shoving my Memorex ear phones , connected with my iPod , I nestled in to the ever so fraudulently comfortable airplane seats and drifter away , suddenly envious of the 1st class fliers with their bed-like seat structure . <newline> Dreams , so vivid it felt like they weren ’ t just actual life , but a part of my soul , crashing through my mind as if they were freight trains without the hindrance of brakes . The dreams came in the forms of odd , slow , and jumbled images . The images twisted around as if imitating an owl ’ s head movement were blurring by my vision , Twisted images all indistinguishable yet , all causing a sense of panic , an almost pain like feeling . <newline> Suddenly awake as if in the blink of an eye I reared my head to the left with a slight gasp , Cold sweat grasping my body in waves causing me to shiver uncontrollably , being asleep for only 40 minutes felt like days as I groggily sat forward , rubbed the sleep from my eyes , withdrawing the buds from my ears I withdrew my laptop from my checked bag as if it would send some comfort to myself having that homily item to rely on . Never leaving home without the square centrality of my life holding everything from work , play , and the pictures of my kids all in one place , astounding the advances of technology truly are as I click the power button and wait for the startup blinking followed by the encouraging tune of music that plays upon arriving at the password page . <newline> CNN , my trusted news source for the last 5 years of my journalism career , anywhere from the cold facts to the stony , dumb bastards running this country , however what I saw upon arriving at the home page was numbing , a shock as if the family dog had just been hit by a vehicle . The flight , the damned flight MY ticket has listed on it 357 . “ Gone , Disappeared , or severely off course , American Airlines flight 357 goes dark ! ” I glance around the aircraft in which all members are still resting as if nothing at all could be the bother . I un-click my seat restraint and move towards the bathroom with a sickly feeling tormenting my stomach as if you just spilled the milk and your step father doesn ’ t like wet shoes . I make my way towards the rest room moving slowly as if in molasses almost to a crawl ... .. <newline>
Stela Malsano confounded every epidemiologist , even someone as knowledgeable as Dr. Anna Walker . "
" Most diseases , you see , spread from an initial vector of infection . A man stumbles into a garbage heap with an open sore and picks up a dangerous bacterium which proceeds to multiply in his body , then spreads it around by coughing and vomiting . A woman orders an exotic undercooked fish at a Japanese sushi restaurant harboring pathogens from the ocean and kisses her children at home . Once the responsible anchors itself in the host , it starts to reproduce and eventually breaks free to infect others . The self-catalytic process repeats itself until it either runs out of hosts , is contained , or simply expires . "
" Not Stela Malsano . When it erupted , it did so instantly around the entire globe as though someone had suddenly pulled a lever , flipped a switch , pressed a button . Entire families on the far side of the earth awoke screaming with vivid hallucinations . Chaos ensued on the highways as drivers seized with convulsions and caught in the grip of lifelike trances lost control of their vehicles , often fatally . Dr. Anna , attending a colloquium on multiverse influence at the University of Illinois , bore witness to the entire room suddenly get up and run around screaming with lunatic abandon . Some thought the zombie apocalypse had begun ; others were convinced that the Rapture was imminent . For a terrifying moment of penetrating clarity Anna wondered if the entire world had gone mad leaving her as the sole sane observer ; almost as quickly , the rational part of her mind suggested the logical counterexample that she might be the only madwoman in a world of normalized lunacy . "
" She was tall for a woman , over six feet in height , with a stern sharp handsomeness to her features . Persistent asthma had plagued her since her late teenage years , but even now as a well-respected professor in her late forties she could force her way past the young graduate student raving about lunar light and barricade herself in her office in the Department of Epidemiology . Panicked screams seeped through the walls in muffled bursts like corrosive waves of toxic miasma and Dr. Anna fumbled for her phone . Her children . Please let them be alright . Risking a peek outside the office window unveiled the panorama of pandemonium ; every human seemed to have gone mad simultaneously outside , running drunkenly into sides of buildings , stumbling , falling , rising up to do it again . The ubiquitous pigeons pecking for seeds on the grassy quads fluttered up to the trees , annoyed by the chaos of their usually orderly lunch . Indignant bird features ruffled at the irrational commotion ; fine , let the earthbound simians stumble around like tangled marionettes ! "
" The hysteria died down within a day , though its effects lingered on the human consciousness for quite some time afterwards . Laboratory epidemiologists almost immediately found the prions responsible for the outbreak , mysteriously dormant again . Radio pundits suggested terrorism . China and North Korea blamed each other . Churches saw record attendance on the next Sunday while public services faced the staggering prospect of repairing wrecked infrastructure left in the wake of the Stela Malsano . After-the-fact reports trickling in from around the globe confirmed that the epidemic had erupted all at once , near simultaneously . "
 It took a long time for life to resume some semblance of normalcy after the outbreak . 
" Alone in her office , Anna 's phone finally connected . `` M-mom ? ! '' a frightened teenage voice asked in trepidation . In the background , Anna discerned more rabid screams and shrieks all around . `` What 's happening ? ! Are you alright ? Where are you - '' "
 `` Leah ? Leah ! Oh thank goodness you 're safe . '' She had to raise her voice to be heard ; the professor nearly jumped out of her skin as a raving man collided with her office door and then sped down the hall . `` Where 's your brother ? Is he okay ? '' 
" `` I do n't know ! He 's was in another class . I 'm in the girls ' bathroom , the stall is locked - mom , what 's happening ? '' Poor Leah sounded on the verge of a breakdown and Anna forced herself to consciously suppress her own sense of rising panic . `` I 'm so scared ! '' "
" The flood of psychiatric assessments and interviews after the epidemic brought to light a number of common symptoms . Vivid hallucinations , often of the moon . Others spoke of a disturbing , sickly emerald light that filled their vision . Societal upheaval inevitably followed : drug addicts swore off their vices to become productive , hard-working citizens while productive , hard-working citizens swore off their virtues to become drug addicts . Dr. Anna , often forced to spend much of her time writing grant proposals to scrounge money from whichever source might be willing to spare her some change for research , suddenly found herself inundated with more funding than she could use . Her senior graduate student quit his studies to go on a journey of spiritual enlightenment . Anxiety-induced deaths spiked sharply worldwide that month . Nine months later , a record number of babies were born globally . "
" `` Leah - Leah , honey , listen to me . I 'll come and get you . Stay safe where you are , '' Anna told her , steadying her own quavering voice . Fear for her children overrode trepidation of the

The nearly comical gasp that came from everyone on the plane was almost like the cheesy soundtrack that accompanies 90s sitcoms . It could have been funny had I not gasped in horror along with everyone else . The familiar notification icon lit up in the lower corner of my vision . "
 ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED : <newline> The Final Countdown 
 My heart skipped a beat . 
" Suddenly highlights from my life were playing across my vision - my first kiss , my wedding , the birth of my son , that weekend we stayed in bed watching movies and laughing together . "
 Everyone knew what this achievement was . It was one of the only ones that each and every one of us would experience one day . 
 The plane began to shudder as everyone closed their eyes and focused on their favorite moments . 
" At least when this software was invented they made sure that the phrase `` life flashing before your eyes '' really meant something .
The explosion rang throughout the city . "
 I could hear the collective screaming of everyone who suddenly disappeared . 
 Why did it leave me ? 
 Why was I the only one left ? 
" My parents , my uncles , everyone I have ever known and loved . "
 Gone . 
 I was the only one left . 
 I could n't believe that it would do this . 
 That Gozerian was a real piece of shit . 
 I was the last remaining the survivor of the catastrophe of New York . 
 I walked for hours trying to find another life form . 
" I searched dad 's firehouse , and our old apartment building , there was no one to be found . "
" I searched dad 's firehouse , hoping to at least find Mr. Tully , I was positive that he could have survived . "
 All I found were his crushed glasses . 
 I headed downstairs to the containment grid and just found a mess of ectoplasm and rubble . 
" I knew that all the ghosts had been freed by the explosion , but now that everyone in New York , including the Ghostbusters , was missing or probably dead , there was not one to re contain the free roaming spirits . "
 That was twenty years ago . 
" The city slowly but surely rebuilt itself , and now I , Oscar Barret-Venkman , am the leader of a new team of Ghostbusters , and I 'll pull Gozer out of that shithole he climbed into and I 'll avenge my parents , my uncles , and all of New York , and hopefully find a way to bring everyone back .
Look , if you 're going to cut down an alley in this part of town dressed like that , I consider it a personal favor that someone as non-violent as myself is going to teach you this life lesson . I launch into Act 1 of our little two-man show , and I have to say that Mr . Fancy really shone in his role as set-upon victim ; I did n't have to put up with any tough-guy bullshit , but he was n't some blubbering , pants-wetting mess that I had to coach through the whole process either . You can tell this guy 's been mugged before , and he has that polite , detached let's-conclude-this-transaction-quickly demeanor that I really appreciate in a mark . I think to myself that everything 's going ol ' Lucky 's way if a man who 's in this tight with my boy Benjamin Franklin decided he did n't have the patience to wait for that Uber like everyone else . I 'm about to wrap things up , but his hand is lingering a little protectively around that right pocket and my intuition starts nagging me that maybe we 're operating with different understandings of the word `` empty '' . Now you do n't need to explain to me about honor among thieves , but it does rustle my jimmies a mite when I 'm doing my level best to keep this a polite and professional experience and the mark thinks he 's going to get clever on me . I present a convincing argument as to the merits of my empty pockets policy to Mr . Fancy in the form of a few right crosses , and he hands me a thumb drive . If he 's willing to buy tickets to my chin music festival for it , I 'm thinking its probably got some financials on it , or maybe a performance art piece he did with the missus . Either way , you bet your ass I 'm checking it out . I leave him zip-tied to the dumpster like usual and stroll back home to count my money per the sage advice of the warrior poet Kenny Rogers . "
" Back home I say hello to Roachy and the boys as they skitter under the fridge , and I review my haul on the kitchen counter with the assistance of a cold can of Nasty Light . It 'll keep the lights on anyway , maybe with a little left over to sock away in my equine investment portfolio down at the track . I figure I 'll check the thumb drive to see if I maybe hit the Powerball , so I pop it in the ol ' porn box and load the drive . One measly .exe file , and I 've opened too many of those from Russian models who want much sexytime to fall for that again . A little disappointed , I toss it and turn my thoughts to how I 'm going to convince Snake tomorrow that this Rolex is a no-shitter . "
" I flip on the TV and some fine-ass blonde is perched above the scroller talking about terrorism , and I 'm just about to flip it over to Cartoon Network when what do I see but some security camera footage of me and Mr . Fancy having our little tete-a-tete . Shit . He must have been some kind of something if taking his lunch money is worth throwing my mug up on cable news . I develop a sudden interest in national security , and turn up the volume . Apparently Mr . Fancy was some Chinese agent moonlighting as a Pentagon IT muckety-muck who was on his way to take down the nation 's energy grid with his trusty thumb drive . The talking heads are on the screen now speculating wildly as to the identity of this masked hero and the current whereabouts of the thumb drive . I cast a nervous glance at the trash can , but as of now it appears that the only one with any pressing interest in it is Roachy . "

They come for me every so often , as they came for my grandmother , and great-great grandmother , before me . They keep tabs on my family , and bless one female in the off-cycle generations with extraordinary longevity , to keep especially gifted Dreamwalkers alive in a fearfully curious reverence . <newline> Over time , millennia of time , our oral history has managed to maintain the truth of Earth life 's origin . It would be considered too ridiculously far-fetched , not to mention morally repugnant , to speak it to anyone not esoteric enough to be part of our personal circle of friends . But the simple fact is that homo sapiens sapiens , and all other creatures , was an experiement performed by a race of beings who fully comprehended ideas that humans are only theorizing in their twenty first century . The idea was to be able to tap into the unending stream of energy that is matter and time , to cut through dimensional static , and then ascertain the most probable of events . After tests performed by their own race failed miserably through insanity , coma , or sudden death , it was decided they needed new cognizant , mentally resilient subjects able to reliably fade in and out of consciousness on schedule . Earth happened to have the correct light/dark cycle , and after the last mass extinction event , was sparsely populated with any life and none to bother the terraformers . "
" I knew I could Dreamwalk before I knew what Dreamwalking was , and I knew it was different from the other types of dreams . Most dreaming is imagining , and in that imagining we create complimentary dimensions that causes chaos for our Creators . And we forget all about the process ; do n't even remember doing it -- or possibly we do . Or we remember incorrectly . It winds up as even more dimensional static . Think of it a bit like how we worry about being trapped on Earth due to `` space junk '' , those Creators are now trapped in a more limited reality due to our dimensional junk . Dreamwalking , where the Walker packs out what they packed in , is tapping into the energy flow and moving harmlessly forward or backward along the thread that is our reality . The Creators can not usually handle it themselves as they already can partly manage the process in their normal state , which is not `` on '' as a human does it , but a bit like that period where a human is `` dozing off '' and is still aware of surroundings but also trying to tune them out . "
" Sometimes those types of Dreamwalking Dreamss are like movies playing out the events as a documentary , and other times the settings of the Dreams matter less than the message the Dreams bring as the specific actions to bring about the end result are not yet set . Perhaps even mentioning the Dream will change things , and so the Dream will never be `` documentary clear '' . It is not a paradox of predetermination any more than watching a raindrop roll down a pane of glass ; you see it is a matter of the perspective of energy . ( Pardon my one pun . ) "
" By virtue of always being tuned in , our Creator race can not truly step back and imagine without losing their nearly-overwhelmed minds or being too inhibited for any sort of success . Humans , by contrast , are able to compartmentalize . We are varied , whereas our Creators are now nearly-depleted clone stock . However , you still see some of them in us , and their goals in us , and our desire to find the truth out there in the stars in us . "
" I did not believe they actually came until I finally left my childhood home . One night they took both me and my roommate , returning us in the early , pre-dawn morning with red marks on our left biceps that looked a bit like the Triforce from 'The Legend of Zelda ' . I know , but can not fully recall , what I had been asked to do or where we had been taken and am hesitant to try to look . I do remember we both noticed the lost time , the marks , and how our captors did not return us correctly to bed . We were not tucked in , but on top of the covers with our clothes on . "
" Therein lies my problem . Yet I am sure if more Dream-sensitive humans could combine their focus we could do even more , but who would believe this ? I sure did n't . Even my mother , whom I suspect is the new long-lived Matriarch , will not believe in the `` alien abduction thing Mom , Your Grandma , always insisted happened to her '' . Not even studying theology and showing her the hidden science in the old stories could convince her the family title is more than a mere honorific . I try reaching out and touching others in their dreams sometimes , the results have been mixed . "
" Our Creators made us long ago to assist them in winning wars for galactic , universal , and dimensional conquest . They will lose , I have Dream-Seen it , even if I know my mortal brown eyes will not even see what our reality will call the official start of hostilities . Our species has managed to compartmentalize horrors , at the expense of joys , although it is using its gift for abstract thought for short term , tangible gains . Even still they can not destroy us for
Terra was always considered the land of misfits . "
" The one place in the galaxy where worlds could dump their unnecessary , and unneeded species from their worlds to ours . Each planet of the federation was granted the ability to drop the entirety of one species off onto Terra to free themselves of the burden of their existence on their own world . Terra was considered a *Death World* . As in it could n't sustain life for long periods of time , due to the general entropy of our solar system , and the fact that earth can only handle so much life at once from packing it full of these *useless* species . The Galactic Federation would cause mass extinction events to `` cleanse '' the planet when it got too packed , essentially a cosmic trashbin for the Galactic Federation . "
" Humanity really was a luck of the draw . After the last M.E.E . of the Galactic Federation , as we know mammals came to be the dominant type of animal on the planet , eventually giving way to the rise of *Homo Sapiens* . Humans were lucky . One in a trillion , usually the beings of energy who lead the Galactic Federation gift the evolutionary path to sentience , and intelligence to a world , but we were the first who came to be in a natural fashion , quite literally diamond in the rough , the treasure in the world of intergalactic trash .

The quiet squeaky steps of my front porch have seldom been kept up . I am a brick house . My interior looks like someone from the 70 's plastered their retro look on me . Baige shag carpet , green and orange wallpaper , I once felt the hustle and bustle of my tenants , but something happened ten years ago that made the first tenants leave . I do n't know if it was something I did or if it was possibly a death in the family.All I know is I was boarded up and left here . I felt at peace , I rested . It felt good to rest those ten years , but recently , some new tenants came in , I do n't remember them knocking . They filled my air ducts with smoke , and I felt the occassional burn singe into my shag carpet . They came 3 months ago . Ever since then I 've felt dirty inside , like there was a grit about me . I overheard one of the tenants scream about drugs and getting high , whatever that means . "
" It 's 2am , I notice cars lining up on the block , only they are n't regular cars , they are police cruisers . Well this is embarrassing , it looks like they are looking at my lot . It has n't been kept up . I feel naked . Oh , there they are lining up ... oh my it looks like they are going to break down the door with that big metal apparatus . I think this is gon na hurt .
I am not like the others . We have all existed since the dawn of time , forever in a constant cycle of death and rebirth . Yet they are unknowing , cut off from their previous lives . I am not so fortunate . I am forced to remember everything . Forced to remember every death , from dying in the Big Bang , to being eviscerated by knights , to dying of tuberculosis , to being riddled with bullets after an unsuccessful raid . I have lived a thousand lives , a burden which my psyche must confront daily as my mind is burdened with the trauma of my demises . And yet I feel bizarrely peaceful in the knowledge that my life is nothing but another link in an endless chain of lives I have left to live .

" Dr. Sam Heinz ran into the emergency room , and smelled the patient before she saw them . She knew that smell , cloyingly sweet with metallic undertones . It affected the stomach in a curious way ; you could feel the scent more than you could smell it . It was not a good feeling . "
" She rushed to the side of the gurney , pushing past the nurses who busied themselves trying to get the patient to breathe . Time seemed to slow down as Sam looked down at him , and he looked up into her eyes . "
" His skin was blanched and had an ever slight unnatural green tint , almost imperceptible in the glaring lights of the ER . Hie eyes were sunken into his face , rimmed in black and bloodshot , oh , so bloodshot . His lips were curled back in an unintended grin , his gums swollen over his teeth . Blood seeped through his teeth in a thick bubbling stream , oozing thick from his nostrils . He made no sound other than a soft gurgling as he tried to breathe . His jaw was clenched tight and his pupils were wide and delirious . They darted around the room , unseeing , before briefly meeting with Sam 's . There was no recognition , no acknowledgement . Then his eyes rolled randomly in their sockets . They moved independent of each other . "
 Sam snapped back to her senses . `` Everyone listen to me ! All of you need to get out of her RIGHT NOW ! '' 
 It took a moment for the activity in the room to lull as the nurses looked towards her . The nurses were stopped mid-activity . No one made a move to leave . 
" `` Goddamn you , LEAVE ! You ca n't stay here - '' "
" Sam was interrupted by a loud wheezing noise , and she whirled to face the patient in horror . He had elevated his back off the gurney by his neck and feet , and he inhaled air violently , with his hands at his throat . His chest expanded as his lungs filled with air - bigger , bigger , BIGGER . Sam tried to scream for everyone to run , but it was too late . "
" The man dropped back down , before shooting up to a sitting position . With no warning , he expelled the air from his lungs with a scream . At least , it would 've been a scream , but it obfuscation was by the blood in his oesophagus . This blood and saliva sprayed out into the room in thick globs and a fine mist ; the miniscule particles floating through the air to land on everyone in the room . The man stopped screaming and slumped forward on himself , before sliding limply off the gurney . "
" Sam , covered in gore , dropped to her knees in resignation . It was too late . It was all too late . They were all infected . She did n't know with what , but they 'd all be dead within three days . They 'd die the same way this man did . They 'd die the same way her husband did , just a day after returning from his year-long service on the International Space Station . They 'd die like her daughter did , two days ago . "
" She was going to die with them , but she knew this before she even walked into the hospital today . The only reason she came was to find a way to save herself . But it was all just ... too ... late . "
" She could already smell it in her skin . That sweet , gut curdling scent that smelled like nothing else on earth .

A sleepy man - woman ? It was hard to tell with all that hair and that lank figure - huddled under blankets , a cup of hot tea in their hands as they stared at the windows . Two windows , on the other side of which was a beautiful world . Full of colors , full of life , full of people . "
" They found themselves - it found itself ? - at a loss for how to describe it . The words from their - its ? - lips floundered , fell , stuttered , and eventually fell silent , feeling inadequate . Piles of letters and phrases littered the floor , and it huddled deeper within its confines , burdened by an overwrought sense of divine presence overbearing its creative design . "
" Behind , on the other side of the seat , a creature with a knife sat , slashing up words that it snatched from the floor . With eyes keen and set on destroying every misplaced syllable , it forgot its true purpose , and the shards and vowels and consonants lay fragile across the floor . A cackle left its lips as it slowly pulled 'floccinoxihiliphilipication ' apart , delicious symbol by symbol , before letting each one hit the floor in turn . "
" The chuckling turned to a mad howling as the blanket suddenly found its way around the little monster , muffling it as the other being rose to its full height and strode to the windows , hands on the windows as it watched the ongoing events outside . Eyes wide , full of wonder , full lines of paper seemed to fall from its mouth in a never-ending stream of fantasy and delight . "
" The little beast screeched and hooted , desiring so much to silence the other in its room , but could only escape once the words stopped .
The tension in the room was incredible . "

" The trade agreement had done a lot for us here on Earth . We are in a position where there is not war , people are people and money is everybody ’ s . We have reached a level where matters between us don ’ t matter . "
 Money brings us all together for once . 
" Back to the tension , see , even I ’ m trying to cut it . "
" A single briefcase full of 5,000,000,000,000 galactic credits . Enough to push us toward standing beside some of the greatest civilizations this universe harbors . "
 For what you ask ? A contract . 
" Those factories are for us . <newline> See , we are the only race in a million planets with opposable thumbs . <newline> And they really like My Little Pony dolls . "
 Deal made . 
 So many pictures . 
 Our future first documented .

`` C'mon gang , let 's investigate ! There have to be some clues around here somewhere ! '' "
" `` But Freeeddiiiiee , this place is so creeeeepy ! Not to mention it clashes with my outfit ... '' "
" `` Do n't worry Daphne , we 're right on the Creeper 's trail , I know it ! Maybe we should split up and look for clues ... '' "
" `` I 'm not sure that 's such a good idea , Fred . '' "
" `` Like , yeah , what if the C-C-C-Creeper shows up ? ! '' "
 *bark ! bark ! * 
" `` See , Scooby agrees with me ! '' "
" I sat up , walking over to the door of the cell and looking through the bars as best I could . Maybe ... maybe these children could help me ? `` Pardon ! '' I shouted , knocking on my door a few times for emphasis . `` Excuse me , children ? Please , come here , I 'm in need of your help ! '' "
" The group that sauntered up to the door were ... textbook , in a sense . Superiority Complex . Narcissism . Mild case of Autism , possible indicators of savant tendencies . Schizophrenia . Probably the only one in a relatively healthy mental state was the Great Dane , and even that assessment was mostly due to the fact that I 'd never studied much animal psychology . "
" `` Zoinks ! Like , what 're you doing in there , Doc ? ! '' the lanky schizophrenic asked . I leaned in close to the bars , whispering . I did n't want to be heard after all . "
" `` I hate to break it to you , but I think there may be ... a *madman* running around here , in a *mask and costume* ! Please , let me out , I need to get the situation under control , there are some very dangerous people in this facility ... '' "
" `` A creeper in a costume ? I knew it ! '' Fredrick exclaimed , and I gave him the least patronizing smile I could muster . Nodding , I pointed down the hall , explaining exactly where the keys were in the office . I went into a bit of detail about the man wandering around Arkham , dressed in a terrifying guise , using fear as a weapon . He fashioned himself a professional , but in all reality he was just a disturbed man preying on the weak . "
" `` Gosh , who woulda thought ! '' the red-haired teen exclaimed , looking around nervously . `` Do you know where the flashlights are ? I would n't want to get caught alone by someone like that ! '' "
" `` I certainly do , '' I replied as the door swung open , stepping out and shaking Velma 's hand vigorously . As I suspected , she grew visibly uncomfortable at the sudden physical contact . `` Let me get them for all of you . I 'm very grateful for the help , but , erm ... who exactly are you all ... ? '' "
" That was enough to let their self-proclaimed leader dominate the conversation for a few minutes , while I traced a familiar route to the western wing . Whenever he 'd start losing steam , I 'd simply ask another question about his constant exploits , or Velma 's eidetic memory , or Scooby 's intelligence . More than once the dog would yap and everyone in the group would turn to look at it . Perhaps they had some mass hallucination , because they 'd act as though the brown mutt had said something profound or funny . "
" `` Say , Doc , where are we headed , anyway ? '' Fred asked , looking around at the change in scenery . No cells here , just offices and laboratories with projects sitting half-finished on tables . "
" `` I need to fetch some things , Fredrick , '' I explained , finally finding the door I was looking for . Locked , of course . I started turning drawers upside down , looking for the keys . `` Chemicals , mostly , for taking care of the psychopath . '' "
" Finally , after tearing apart half the offices , I found the ring that had the all-important keys on it . Stalking back to the heavy bolted door , I started trying them one by one . "
" `` They wo n't ... like ... hurt him or anything , will they ? '' "
" `` Yeah , we 've got great ideas for some traps we can set up to catch -- '' "
" `` No , and no . '' I replied , searching the shelves . Face cream . Joy buzzer . Green hat . Metal umbrella . "
 `` Jinkies ... what is all this stuff ? They do n't look like doctor 's tools ! '' 
" `` No , they 're not . '' Toga . Bullwhip . Coin with a well-worn face . "
" `` Doc ... uh , why do you keep your chemicals in here ? '' "
" `` I do n't , Daphne , others do . '' Puppet with a tommy-gun . Giant rubber mallet . Top hat with a 10/6 size tag tucked into it . A-*ha* . I bent down , collecting my tools again at last . "
 *bark ! bark ! * 
" `` Answer Scooby , man , what kinda doctor are you ? '' "
" `` Hmm
It was supposed to be a routine mission . Nothing we had n't seen before . Just another cleanup round trip through the washing machine and the dryer . We 'd done this a hundred times . But I guess even if you 've been on the force for years they still can surprise you . "
" The trip through the washer went without any trouble . Lev was showing off his newly patched heel during the ride . Red wool . Apparently that 's the fashion nowadays . Said I should get my own looked at . Do n't see a reason to . Yea , my heel is getting sheer , but it 's still holding up . I do n't trust those shrinks and tailors . Do n't like needles . Lev just grins . "
" I always get the shivers when we enter the dryer . Call it childhood trauma , but we all got our baggage . I got used to it , but this time something is different . We are getting pushed too far off to the side . <newline> “ Lev , I do n't like this place . Smells awful lot like a trap to me ” , I mumble and pull up my cuff . <newline> “ You worry too much , Rick . Come on , partner , what could possibly go wrong ? ” Lev leans back and pokes the polished metal wall of the dryer . “ They build these things to be safe . The other day I read that you are more likely to get burnt by lightning than to disappear in a dryer. ” <newline> He does n't convince me . I pull a bundle of fluff from my pocket and start chewing on it . Old habits die hard . "
" Then we start spinning . I try not to think about it . I need to distract myself . “ So how 's your patched heel holding up ? ” , I ask . <newline> No answer . <newline> “ Lev ? ” I turn to look at him , but his space is empty . “ LEV ! ” <newline> Hectically , I scan the area . My world is spinning . Literally . Suddenly I spot something . A thin thread of red , caught in a gap of the drum . I give it a closer look . It 's good quality wool , and the same color as Lev 's new fucking patch . <newline> “ Shit. ” I look down into the gap . Darkness . “ Lev ? Are you down there ? ” The thread twitches . Without further thought , I jump into the darkness . "
" When I come back to my senses , every single one of my threads hurt . I think some of them might be ruptured . I check my heel . Still sheer , but no permanent damage . So far so good . I try to get my bearings . Where the hell am I ? I ca n't see a damn thing . I hear the rumbling hum of the dryer above me . I must have slipped into the bowels of the beast . It is pitch black . I feel something lying on the ground . Lev 's thread . I grab it and crawl forward . The place is cramped , the air is hot and wet . Slowly I adjust to the darkness . I can see pipes and eagerly turning gears . Steam hits my gusset , but I crawl onward . <newline> Suddenly , the ground disappears beneath my foot and I fall again . <newline> The landing is soft . Softer than I 'd like . A bad feeling grips me . Bodies . Heaps of them . I hear a moan . <newline> “ Lev ? ” <newline> Silence . I carefully pat the ground beneath me . “ Rick ? ” I hear a weak voice whisper . <newline> “ Lev ! Buddy , I am coming for you ! ” Frantically I start clawing my way towards the faint sound . Then I find him . He is leaning against the wall , limp and barely holding up . <newline> “ Rick . Rick , they got me. ” <newline> “ Do n't talk now , I got ta patch you up . I 'll get you outta here. ” <newline> “ No , it 's too late for that . I 'm sorry. ” He shifts and so I can see his heel . My voice fails . His side is torn open all the way from cuff to foot . <newline> “ They got me good. ” He tries to laugh , but he only coughs out loose threads . “ Real shame about the wool. ” <newline> “ You ca n't do this to me ! We are a team god dammit ! Do n't you dare chicken out now ! ” <newline> “ You were right all along , Rick . This place is a deathtrap . You have to- ” He breaks off , coughing up more threads . “ You have to put an end to this. ” <newline> I grimace . <newline> “ Promise me. ” Then he goes limp . Even more so than before . "
" I get up . Time to end this . I look up at the twisting gears and spit a ball of fluff at it . The gnawing metal teeth eagerly dig into it . The machine halts for a moment , chokes but then the gears rip the fine threads apart and the dryer roars to life again . <newline> I sigh . Looks like I 'll need something tougher . I find myself a new ball of fluff to chew and start running towards the
The Door of Dimensions loomed before the nervous party . Its intricate orange patterns swirled back and forth , not tethered to normal space , normal reality . Soon , the party would enter the ancient gateway , into an unknown world . "
" The Door had been discovered eons ago . For as long as anyone could remember , the bravest of adventurers had led expeditions through it . Every time a group entered the Door , they found themselves in a new , unexplored world . When you entered the door , you either came back rich and glorious , or you did n't come back . Their party , the Crimson Banners , was one of the few adventuring companies to have not yet led an expedition through the ancient portal . They had done everything there was to do in their homeland of Esper . Led by the mighty human Paladin , Garon Godstrong , the Crimson Banners had slain dragons , conquered ancient dungeons , and performed great feats for many years . However , the task that lay before them was a new one . "
" It had been an arduous and taxing journey to reach the Door of Dimensions . The week long trek up the steep mountain pass was said to weed out those not worthy of launching an expedition into another world . The Crimson Banners , however , had not become known as the champions of death by sheer luck . For the experienced crew , the journey proved easy . When at last the band of allies reached the peak , their aging elven Wizard , Mastrae , immediately began to perform the ancient rite required to open the glowing doors . As he chanted in a long forgotten language , the weight of what was awaited them settled upon the party . A nervous quip was heard from the timid gnome Rogue , Dumpkins , just before the great stone slabs slid open , revealing the swirling chaos behind . A brief word of encouragement from Garon , and the party stepped forward . "
" Immediately , they were surrounded by an indescribable chaos . Up was down , left was right . Colors and smells and sounds mixed in a confused vortex . After what seemed like an eternity , the terrified party felt their feet hit solid ground . Decades of training led them to immediately snap to their senses , analyzing their surroundings . However , doing so only left them more confused . They were standing on a hard grey stone with lines painted on it . There was grass surrounding them , but it was the deadened brown of winter plants , despite the moderate temperature . In the distance there were towers made of thin struts , with barely visible ropes running between them . To one side , they could see a bulbous structure , with a sloped base , and a large sphere at the top , made of some nondescript white material . Looking at eye level , they saw a row of buildings . The buildings were clearly made by more skilled hands than those who had created the hamlets and villages the group was used to . They were made of the same strange material , but in varying shades of garish blues , yellows , and pinks.They had the shingle roofs normally reserved for only the richest of nobles . "
" Yet , despite craftsmanship that even the grandiose High Elves would envy , the houses were clearly in disrepair . Some of them were collapsed , others had walls blown out , and the plants were in a state akin to a gardener 's worst nightmare . The stone they stood on was cracked and ruined . There were hunks of curvy metal with circles at their bases stood at the edge of the road here and there . "
" Strangest of all was the structure planted right in the middle of the streets . Made of a haywire collection of materials , it stood at an almost physics defying angle . A poorly made gate stood at the front . The confused and scared party approached it , then ducked down for cover when they heard voices from inside . Two men seemed to be talking . Quieting themselves down for a moment , the party strained their ears , attempting to hear what they said , in an attempt to find out what was going on . One sentence came to them clearly . "

The alarm clock next to me blared it 's loud , obnoxious sound , greeting me in it 's own way to the new morning . I shut the clock off with a forceful slap of my hand , it was another day in hell . "
" `` Good morning , dear ! '' My wife called from outside the bedroom . She was cheerful as ever , cheerful as always , I could barely remember the last time I saw her sad . "
" `` Good morning , father ! '' The twins said in unison , as I entered the kitchen . My breakfast of freshly cooked bacon and eggs was still steaming . "
" `` Morning , everyone . '' I said solemnly , I picked at the eggs until the yolk burst and the yellow goo started mixing with my plate . My wife caught me at the door before I left for the day . <newline> `` Anything wro- Have a fantastic day ! '' her concern was appreciated but unnecessary , I had hoped the change would `` stick '' like it had with all the others but she was always stronger than the rest . Maybe , that 's why I still loved her , with what little love I still possessed . "
" My commute was the same as always , the train passengers performed a rendition of `` Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go '' I smiled and clapped along as I usually did . It was crap though , Joey , from Water & Power was a little flat , like he had been for the past 5 years . No matter how hard I tried I could n't motivate him into some singing lessons . I guess that was n't part of my powers . "
" The receptionist greeted me with that same fake smile that she gave me the first day I enter Dr. Kapowitz 's office . It had struck me as so false , so plastic , that I decided she 'd wear that same look every time I saw her . I guess it reminded me of my own smile . "
" `` Hello ! James ! Another beautiful morning is n't it ? So what 're we talking about today ? '' The Doc said in that same overly cheerful tone , as she picked up her notepad and started taking notes before I had even spoke . "
" `` I 'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up . I saw so much sadness and pain in all of you and it made me feel terrible . When I learned I could do something about it , that I could change people 's emotions , I felt like a god . I had control over everything . Emotions are powerful motivators . Of course I did it all for myself , I made everyone feel happy because of how sad I felt . I figured that over time I too , would become cheerful . That was 20 years ago . Seems to me like the only person whose emotions I can not control , are my own . '' <newline>
''It 's the end of the World ! '' Mario screamed while punching the wall in our locker room . "
" ''It 's not buddy , relax . Time will pass , it will go away '' I knew my words mea n't nothing but I had to pretend they did . "
 ''It wo n't go away ! Not something like this ! '' He said while still punching . He must of had a few broken knuckles by now . 
" I did n't know what else to say . These things happened every year , in every school across the country . You laugh at it when it 's some stranger 's story on a blog , but when it 's your best friend ... "
 Hazing was a common tradition for football teams but that did n't mean things could n't cross the limit . A broomstick in the ass ? What was the point of that ? 
" It was just one man and one broom . But for Mario , it was enough to be the end of his world .
I watched as Kevin made the small flame dance across the tabletop to the delight of everyone who watched . "
 `` That 's awesome Kev . '' I said as he snuffed out the small flame . The small crowd that had gathered around to see Kevin show off his newfound power groaned with disappointment and begun discussing their own experiences . 
" Ever since the human race had been changed in the event , everybody developed a power by the time they were twenty-one . Some were major , some were minor , and some were useless . But everyone was regulated . Those who refused went rogue , and had to deal with the big guys . "
" `` What did the examiners say ? '' Said Stacey , sitting down at the table . As always , she had several flowers interwoven into her hair . Each one was pointed toward the window . Stacey could control plants , make them grow , make them move , some people said she was actually part plant . "
" `` They think my powers will grow , they said to come back in a few years , as it is I ca n't make a flame much bigger than my hand for now ! '' Kevin said , igniting a small fire ball in his hand again . "
" Without warning a torrent of water bounced across the table , literally bounced , before splashing over Kevin 's hand and extinguishing his flame , not to mention soaking the entire table . "
" `` Hey ! '' Kevin said , looking towards the culprit . "
" Laughing , Brad strode towards the group and sat down with a flop , water twirling around his wrist in a constant stream . He always kept a little bit of water on his body , mostly for pranks . "
" `` Pft . So you can light candles now , big deal . You 'll probably never advance beyond that ! '' "
" `` Jerk . '' Said Kevin . But he was smiling . I smiled too . It was unlikely that any of my friends would be placed into duty for the Establishment , but that was fine , that way they would n't be hurt . Their powers were minor , so they were allowed to roam free . "
" Stacey turned to me suddenly , ignoring the small wrestling match that had broken out between Kevin and Brad . "
 `` You must be excited huh Drew ? '' 
 `` What do you mean ? '' I said . 
 `` Well you turn 21 next month right ? You should be getting your power any day now . '' 
" `` Hey that 's right ! '' Said Kevin , who had Brad in a headlock . `` Any idea what it might be ? '' "
" `` Oh , I guess I had n't really thought about it . '' I said , smiling . "
" `` What ! ? '' said Brad , pushing Kevin away . `` How can you not think about it ? '' "
" `` I dunno , I 've been busy lately ? '' "
" All three of my friends looked at me like I was insane . I simply smiled . After all how could they know that I already had my powers . That my examination was falsified every year , because technically , I did n't exist . I went rogue . My power manifested itself at 16 . And when the inspectors came around for my first test at 17 , I killed them . "
" Because you see my power is different , my power comes from a darker god than theirs . With a simple touch , I can take . Take anything , take everything . Your mind , your looks , your memories , your voice , your sight , the air from your lungs , the cells in your brain , the blood from your veins , your power . I can remove them , I can keep them . So far I 've remade my face three times , and I have taken the powers of those who have come to find out mine . And disposed of any who came close . I have been 20 for over 5 years , each year with a new face , new blood , new body , new cells , new powers . So far I 'm bulletproof , I can teleport , and following a truly spectacular fight , I can control the weather . I do n't age , but maybe this year I will . Maybe this year I stop hiding . "
" But first I think I 'll see how strong Kevin 's power gets . Fire sounds fun .
I looked him straight in the eyes , only a young man though he looked much older . I could see the fear in his eyes almost accepting his fate . "
 `` I 'm sorry ... its just the way things are . '' I said grimly . 
" He must have noticed my cold tone . It was n't that I did n't care , I could n't care . This part of the job became second nature . Part of the routine . Doctors worldwide adopted the policy at the turn of the 22nd century . "
 `` I understand but I 'm sure there is something you can do ... we can just keep it between us right ? '' He stuttered desperately . 
" I handed him a pamphlet titled `` Accepting Death '' a standard procedure for all my patients . The role of doctors changed over the years . When I was a child they were known as protectors , carers and people who would help you and make you feel better . It all changed after the Crop Wars . There is never going to be enough food to feed the masses . We can no longer take care of the sick . "
" `` I can talk you through it after you have had a moment to clear your head . '' I said calmly stepping out to give the man some space . He glanced up from the pamphlet , tears in his eyes . "
 `` Okay . Just give me 5 minutes '' He said softly with a somewhat forced smile . 
" I closed the door behind me and went out the back for a cigarette . The damp humid air would n't keep me outside for long . Before I could inhale the last drag I heard a crash followed by the sounds of shattering glass . I immediately tossed the cigarette but into the alley and flung open the metal door to return to my office . Before I had a chance the young man pushed his way passed , his strength overpowering me , pushing me to ground . "
 `` You are n't authorised to leave ! You need to come back or I 'll call the police ! '' Shouted the nursed clearly distressed . 
" I regained my breath and stood up preparing to give chase , knowing an escaped patient would likely be the end of my career . I ran through the damp dreary alley way towards the bus stop on the corner of the street . The man , despite suffering from an illness had far more stamina than myself as he slowly gained a greater lead . "
 My luck turned when a passing peace officer noticed the scuffle and pulled his vehicle in front of the young man . Just like that it was over . The man was no match for the strength of a government officer . He was wrestled the ground with a boot pressed into his face . 
 `` He one of yours ? '' The the officer asked sternly . 
" I looked down at the man and I felt something I had n't felt in years . Empathy . This man was n't the tyrant government propaganda portrayed the sick as . He was somebodies brother , husband and son . "
 `` He ... is a friend of mine . We just had a little disagreement . '' I lied . I could n't let this man be imprisoned and likely tortured to save my own ass . 
 `` We 'll get your friend back inside I ca n't have people running around thee streets like that . '' The office loosened his grip and nudged the mans limp body towards the kerb . 
 As the officer left the man looked up at me . `` Why did you do that ? You could have ended up in jail ? '' 
 `` I can help you ... I ca n't keep living this way '' I stammered . 
 `` Help me what ? Escape ? '' He replied . 
" `` No I can help save you , we have the medicine . I know it 's breaking the law but someone needs to make changes . It was n't always this way . '' "
" `` You mean you can actually cure me ? I do n't have to die ? '' Hope filled his eyes , his face lit up with an almost cautious joy . "
 `` Doctors used to be healers . Believe me ... there was a reason I choose this profession and it was n't to end lives ... there was once a time where we saved them '' I grabbed the mans hand and slowly walked him back to the office . 
" `` You will have to come with me , there is no safety at the office . They will always be watching over me '' I said "
" I took the man into my car I knew it was n't going to be an easy mission . But if there is going to be any change in the world , if I am going to make a difference . I have to change the world one patient at a time . And it starts today . <newline>
This quilt , that my mother made , "
 Still makes me think to this day . 
" It 's softest brown , and brightest blue , "
" The curved stitch here , reads `` made it May '' . "
" It 's hard to see , but believe me it 's true , "
 That 's not just a cloth but a piece of shirt . 
" You can see a logo here , and right there , "
" And a signature over there , someone named `` Bert '' . "
" This is my favorite part , a piece from a stuffed bear . "
" I think it was my mother 's favorite too , "
 She always said so at least . 
" Something from when she was two , "
 Given by her grandad for Thanksgiving feast . 
" My dad added this , a little button pin , "
" Something from his mother , for being a scout . "
" Apparently she went to a store and fished in a bin , "
" Until night that day , to teach him what love was about . "

 but their funeral was delayed . 
 
"
It 's the job of our agency to keep track of the worlds monsters and keep them locked down . Which is complicated because people are n't allowed to know they exist or that they create them . "
" Fear itself , when amplified by a large amount of people , fearing that same thing enough ... produces a monster to represent it , it simply comes to life and exists . We stop said Monsters from destroying us . We always do . "
" <newline> This time just over a decade ago , our job got a lot harder , a new breed of monster had appeared , and it was more dangerous than we ever suspected possible . "
 The thing about the old monsters is they 're like the fear they represent : 
" Werewolves were simply animals , animals that stick to the forest , they 're easy to explain to locals and generally do n't even cause much trouble so long as they 're left well enough alone , we picked off the aggressive ones and left the rest alone . "
" Vampires were a problem for a long while , because like the aristocracy they represented , they liked to lord it over people . To show off their power . Made it very hard to keep them a secret , but also easy to find them and destroy them before the fear they created spread too far . The few around today only stay alive because they do n't act like the monsters they are , so it has been nightmarishly difficult to finish them off , but they 're generally no longer our biggest issue . "
" With Modern medicine as it is , zombies went extinct long ago with the fear of disease that created them . <newline> They were n't like one would imagine them though , they were slow and stupid sure ... but also silent , they 'd spread by bite , but not moan or be loud doing it . During the black death they killed as many people as the disease itself as fear of disease produced more than we were able to handle . "
 <newline> However now ... a new monster has come about . We did n't even realize it -was- a monster until we captured one . Because they destroy themselves mere seconds after they pop into existence . 
" What much of the world knows as 'Suicide bombers ' , we found out their true form . So far as we can tell , there have been few genuine suicidal terrorists acts - 9/11 being the one that caused enough fear of terrorism to bring these monsters into existence . However now they jump into existence wherever there 's enough fear and tension and after they die , they 've left only more fear in their wake , leading to -more- coming into existence later . "
" So if not humans , what are they ? Well . They have human faces , and hands ... but the rest of them is anything but . Their limbs are made of some kind of shadow and their chest of fire - which when they release to explode and cause mayhem . "
" We only captured one after a brave marine tackled one to the ground - it would have made no difference , but in doing so he also accidentally starved the flames of oxygen -just- long enough to stop them becoming intense enough to remain , at which point the being became only shadow . "
" The creature is pitiful if it does n't get to die soon after forming - the mask it uses to represent a face swiftly begins to rot , lasting only a minute at most the hands soon mold until they too are shadow . <newline> And then ... it just dies , it dissipates into the essence that makes up all monsters . "
" In a weird fit of irony , their purpose is the same as their fears creators - get as much attention as possible and use it to spread fear . And oh boy have they been doing so ... we just ca n't stop them . "
" Because one can get over the fear of something that fears the sun , that only comes out on a full moon or is simply countered by modern medication . <newline> If things get any worse , if we do n't stop the media spreading the fear -and hence the monsters- we 're going to have to fear a whole new ending to the world . "
" `` This is the way the World ends , not with a whimper . But with a BANG . ''
The first punch gets me right in the ribs , knocking the wind out of me . I half-crawl towards him from where I fell on my ass , feeling the flush of adrenaline starting to take hold . "
" It 's a dirty fight , I suppose . We focus on causing as much pain as possible - cruel to be cruel . He stinks . "
 ******** 
" The actual first punch was somewhat expected . The sun was hot , uncomfortably so , but we felt obligated to enjoy it . The ground in our neighbourhood was both more and less interesting in the summer . Deep cracks and canyons traced out a huge map that stretched from his backyard to the fabled danger-zone of the main road , but it lacked the fascination of living and moving insects , driven underground by drought . "
" What else could two boys do , but fight ? It was fun . We laughed afterwards . We compared bruises for weeks ; his turned yellow first . <newline> If there was blood , I do n't remember it . "
 We both of stunk afterwards . Of sweat and dirt and pure heat . 
 ******** 
" He 's lost weight - or , rather , is in the process of losing it . The bones in his wrists are becoming visible . "
" It 's summer again , not that you would know with the blinds so thick . They 've trapped the air , and it 's warm without any real heat . "
" Cliché , really , to be like this now . *He was such a nice kid ... * Everyone was . Everyone is . I have n't reconnected , run into him on the street ; people fall by inches . "
 He starts to cry . Not like in the movies . It 's mostly snot ( mixed with a little blood ) . Drool begins to gather at the corners of his mouth . I have to look away . 
"
Some nights I lay awake staring at the ceiling . When I wake up I swear I can see your ghost in the corner of my vision . But whenever I turn my head the only thing there is the white wall staring back at me . I think back to the fun we had . Camping in the mountains staring at the stars . Sneaking into the local pool to skinny dip . I didn ’ t know how to live until I found you . Now I can barely remember what it is to live . What it is to feel . I try to go through my day like before . It ’ s harder waking up in an empty bed . Harder only having my music to break the silence as I get ready . But I have to have the music . Without the music I ’ m left alone with only my thoughts . And that is what I try to avoid at all costs . I still work the same desk job you got me . The looks I get going down the hall cut into my soul . Some show pity . Some empathy . After I leave work I go to the bar , the only place that doesn ’ t ask questions . I ’ m not asked how I am . They just give me my vodka and leave me to wallow . I always hope I can drink myself into enough of a stupor that I can actually sleep . Maybe I ’ ll even get lucky and crash on the way home . Then I won ’ t have to answer the questions that are always asked . Or deal with the glances that people shoot but think I don ’ t see . By the time I get home I ’ m usually too drunk to even make it to the bed . But somehow I did last night . And as I fell from consciousness , I thought of you . I thought of falling asleep with you in my arms . I wished for the warmth of your body against mine . I yearned for the comfort of your breath next to me . When I felt the wind against me I passed it off as the window left open . When I felt warmth against me I thought it was the liquor warming me . But now I start to wonder . As I sit here staring at you I question if I ’ m still drunk or the most sober I ’ ve been in weeks . I can ’ t believe all the details that are still there . I can see your beautiful green eyes that I fell in love with . I can see the scar on your palm that you got when you tried to help that stray dog and it bit you . I can see the blood on your head and shirt from where you went through the windshield when we hit the tree . But worst of all I see your mouth stuck open screaming in horror the same way it was as you died next to me . I should have pulled over . I should have stopped to sleep . But I wanted to get home to lay bed with you . Now I know why I ’ ve seen you morning after morning . You miss me as much as I miss you . I think instead of work I ’ ll go back to sleep . I ’ ll slide aside so you can lie next to me . Take you in my arms again . Now I know it wasn ’ t the wind against me . It was you watching me . Watching me sleep in my bed while you sleep in the ground . Well no longer . You ’ re here for me now . I have you in my arms again . I embrace the cold that you bring as much as the warmth that once came with you . At last I will be able to sleep with my sweetheart again . <newline> Some Nights - FUN
I can hardly read the letter , because the hand holding it is shaking so bad . My hand . There 's nothing wrong with me , I 'm just nervous . I 'm actually a pretty normal guy , painfully normal . But that 's all about to change . "
" *Dear Mr. Thompson , we are quite happy to inform you that we have successfully received and processed your requests , as well as your official test results . It is with great pleasure that I can relay to you , on behalf of The United States Department Of Supernatural Distribution , that you are officially licensed to generation and application of banishment , disappearance , and-* "
" The sturdy stationery and pompous print fade from view . Everything is temporarily blurry , and I feel my nose flare and quiver for a moment , before the rest of my body joins in . I 'm not much of a crier , and make a pathetic scene for a moment as I let the emotion wash over me . Finally . Finally . Fucking finally . I blink the tears out of my eyes , and hear the soft thud as they land on the paper . I look down again , and next to a tear drop I read , *your superpower will be rendered available as soon as you read aloud the following code : USER556865REQ55432 . In accordance with federal law , you must destroy this document upon activation . * "
" It is the most amazing , natural thing . I just wave my hand , focus on an object , and.. boom ; it 's gone . Or transported amazingly to a location of my choosing . It 's like magic , except it 's not . It 's a superpower , and one I can now use to my heart 's content . Of course there 's laws and regulations , but with great power comes blah blah blah yada ya . I focus on the document for a second before transporting it from my hand to my desk before Vanishing it altogether . So . Damn . Cool . What now ? I think the answer to that is pretty obvious . "
" The video clip is pretty short , and I filmed it myself . The shot zooms in on my sink overloaded with dishes , two weeks worth . The camera then turns to me , and my frown lets the viewer know that I 'm not happy about it . As it turns back to the sink , my hand waves across the frame . Boom , they 're gone . To erase any doubt , I open the dishwasher and ta-da , they 're neatly stacked on the racks within . The final scene is my smiling face . Facebook . Instagram . Snapchat . Upload , upload , upload . # Lifestough "
" Two hours later , I check my posts . One response , and 13 combined likes . Mom says `` congratulations '' , but she did n't even put an exclamation mark at the end . My heart sinks . I 'm so damn sick of being the last one to every trend . "
 I wish my superpower would disappear . 
" Just kidding , it 's still pretty cool .
`` They do n't believe we 're interesting ? '' one of the younger mermaids , Ari , asked , looking around the elders of the council . Of all the reasons for the decline of the last several decades , *interest* had not been one she had thought about . Low birthrates , weak magic , and increased illness and death in their people had spurned the mer- and hydro- species to gather and think of something to stop what would soon be the end of them all . That it was the human 's fault was implied , but how was the question . "
" `` It is the fault of their aeroplanes , '' an old mermaid replied . Ari did not know her personally , they were from different seas , but the merwoman had been kind to her despite her age . Ari was the only representative healthy enough from their bay to journey here , even if she was young . "
" `` Ships are not used as much for transport , '' the Pacific mermaid continued . `` And when they are they are so big and well-made that our songs do not reach them . There is no reason to fear us . We may look pretty , become a tale to tell with friends if we are seen , but then we are forgotten . '' "
" `` Which is a problem , '' a siren added . She lounged on a giant open clam , the self-appointed head for this group . Her songs at least , on occasion , brought about disappearances around Bermuda . `` Belief does not have to be real to fuel magic , to fuel *us* . Interest in fictional variations of our kind would be enough . But all of that is now taken up by vampires , or zombies . And we ? From what I hear I am relegated to literature no one reads for pleasure , and my dear mermaids you are children 's toys . '' "
" `` Children have interest , '' the old mermaid replied . `` About a quarter century ago we had several good years . I began to find dolls and toys in the sewage near people that showed a red haired mermaid . '' "
 `` But only for a while . You know soon after that it was lions or some other nonsense . '' 
" `` Then.. '' the younger mermaid began her thought , but paused . The elderly mermaid smiled to her and nodded for her to continue . The siren looked interested . Ari turned to the oceanids and nereids- it had been something they had said earlier that day that now came back to her . "
" `` Then perhaps we must do what our ancestors did , '' Ari said . `` We come up to the surface , to the isles , up the deep rivers because we had to get to the people . Now they have other ways of transport , but water is important to us all . We must simply find other places to dwell . '' "
" `` Yes ! '' a nereid added . `` My cousin , she went to the beaches and then amid the people and their buildings when my young brother became sick . She found small ponds with no fish or plants , but where many people would go to play . It was close to home , so at night she could return , but during the day she enticed two young men into such a frenzy they fought for her in the deep end and drowned ! My brother 's fever broke and he is now well because of their deaths and fear . '' "
" `` Exactly ! '' Ari gestured to the other young woman . `` We have to go to them , make ourselves known . '' "
" `` It could work , '' the elderly mermaid said . `` We did always see who could go closest , and the one who brought someone in from the land would win . But lately such games have not been on our minds with the bad times . '' "
" `` We just have to make sure they know it is us , and not something silly like sharks . '' "
" Now inspired , the group began making plans for their emigration onto land and the shallow waters . The young people , those who were healthy and could take the shape of humans , would slowly begin to the move to the fresh waters and those lakes and ponds that did not return to the ocean . The occasional drowning would be a good start , and as they settled into their new homes they could connect with that new part of the world . Surely a lake , even a pool or a fountain , needed a spirit as much as the ocean or a river did ?
Not a single person in the crowd of Nora Janice 's Funeral had spoken a word . Friends , Relatives , and a few other people all bonded together in the stillness of the moment . Even Nora 's own parents were seen , with no idea how she could have been a part of such a horrible death . Soon , an image appeared in the front of the room . The image of Norah soon became a video , and papers were heard rustling around . Tears could be seen creeping down the young eyes of the girl , and those tears began to spread throughout the room as she spoke . "
" > Hello . If you are hearing this , t-then they must have gotten to me . I do n't know why , but I know that soon I will be ... dead . I pray you never have to hear this , but I guess if you are hearing this , it 's too late . "
" The camera showed a barren room with notes on a desk in the front , a plain chair , and dim lighting highlighting the webcam glow on Nora 's youthful face . It must have been recorded very recently before her death , but she still looked too young for someone like her to be gone so soon . "
" > Ok , I need to start at the beginning I guess . Most of you must have known me as a perfect little girl with a great heart and all that . That 's not the full me . Ok , ok , calm down , I 've never told anyone this , calm down . "
" By this time , everyone in the crowd had undergone a change from a teary-eyed and mournful mood to some feeling much more intrigued . Nora was n't a crazy conspiracy theorist , or ever been mentally unstable . Well , maybe she did seem a bit strange at times , but the way she was speaking now made her seem absolutely insane . "
" > When I was kid , I had terrible nightmares . Every time I had one of these nightmares , it was the same kind of thing . I saw people dying . But - Here 's the thing , it actually happened . Like , I was dream of some man I 'd never seen before getting beaten to death with a club , and a few days later I would see him on the news as a murder victim . Now it happens - or , well - happened , about every month or two . A few stand out in my brain . A week before 9/11 was horrible . I tried to help out a stranger I saw on the streets , but to no avail . He would n't listen , I tried to warn him ! "
" Now , the audience was fidgeting . Nora 's parents were the most shocked , and all the others in the room were mimicking their expressions . Sure , maybe a few things about the way she acted made sense now , but she was just another girl . At least that 's what everyone in the room had thought for the last 20 or so years she 'd been alive . "
" > For the past week , I have been having a different kind of vision in my sleep . I see myself . I 'm in some room of my house , and someone walks in . I 'm laying on my desk , and I ca n't see his face . Papers are laying around everywhere , and he just walks over to me with , s-some kind of gun or something , and then ... and then I wake up . I know it 's going to happen soon , and , i just do n't know when . Probably in a couple of days , but it could be soon . I just- I do n't know what to do . "
" On screen , she began to lay her head down in pure fear . She threw some of her notes down on the floor , and they gently rested down on the floor . The video feed stood still for a moment , then a creaking was heard . A door opened , and a man walked in . The man looked down at Nora , and shot .
`` Brigands and cutpurses have nothing on me . They 're petty , cheap thugs who burgle for petty , cheap coin . Wine and women must come easily to such people . '' "
 The stranger looks unimpressed . I continue my spiel . 
" `` I 'm more refined . Better than a common thief . Smarter than the lot of them put together , too . '' "
" Her distaste shows on her lips , as they curl up in disgust . She speaks for the second time . `` And I 'm sure you spend your hard earned coin on nothing but the noblest of pursuits , too . Nothing but charities and your future , I 'm certain . '' "
" Her words hardly leave a mark in my indignant reply . `` What , then , did you want from our town ? You requested a companion for some brute force crusade type deal , and you 're surprised the clientele is all of the lowborn variety ? Get a grip , paladin . '' "
" Her hand shifts to the hilt of her scabbard , running gloved fingers over the symbol inscribed there . She lifts her eyes to the heavens . "
" `` Bloody divines never gave us nothing . And here you are , shiny armor and shiny sword , trying to muster us up ? For what , then ? Why do you even need one of us fine gentlemen ? '' "
" She declined to respond , her view of the overcast sky must have given her all the direction she needed . Without another word , she spun on her heels , the soft clangs of her armor trailing behind her as she smartly walked away . "
" I turn back to my compatriots , who had been listening intently to our exchange . `` We 'll rob her tonight . ''
Sergeant Clark lifted his wrist to look at the band wrapped around it . It was no different than the fitness trackers people wore , except that it was reinforced by thick ropes of steel . It looked boring , actually . Black , some kind of supple rubber . A little digital heart pulsed consistently beside of a number that read 96 . A cold blade of panic pierced his back , shooting a chill up his neck and across his scalp . He swallowed against an entirely too-dry throat , feeling the tissue scrape across itself like sandpaper . The sensation gagged him and he had to suppress his body 's reflex to retch . "
" He managed to tear his eyes from his own wrist to a face concealed by a mask without contour or color . `` You have 60 seconds . If your heart still beats after , the nuclear bombs will launch . It does n't matter what countries will be hit . What matters is the one that fired them . The USA . '' "
" It was strange where his mind went as he targeted the stranger with the barrel of his gun . He thought of how he 'd never have a dog . His parents would never let him have one of his own growing up and life had never given him the opportunity to bring one into his life as an adult , between never having an apartment that allowed him as he failed out of college , and all of the travel required by his secret career . He did n't think of Lucy or his mom . He thought of this dog , that probably would have been brown and white or something and ate its own vomit . He would 've named it Daniels , because Jack would 've raised some brows with the reputation Sergeant Clark had made for himself . "
" Hands numb , he lowered the barrel of his gun . The number on the wristband was nearing 200 . He felt disconnected from his body other than his nose , which was ice cold . He closed his eyes and smiled . He did n't know what was funny , but he could n't deny that something was . He relaxed his shoulders , let the rifle fall slack on its strap across his chest , and pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip . The metal should 've been cold against his temple , but he would n't have noticed it had it not been for the determined pressure of it . Almost forgetting them , Sergeant Clark turned to face his squad . Why ? He was n't sure . Maybe to say he was sorry . Maybe to thank them for his time with them the last five years . Maybe it was so the last thing he saw before he died was a familiar face , if not a friend . "
" Instead , what he saw was the barrels of five guns with highly trained fingers on the triggers . He was glad he could n't see their eyes . "
" Sergeant Clark holstered his pistol in a practiced , mechanical movement and gave a short nod that was both an order , a pardon , and an apology all at the same time . "

I never thought working with CPS would be easy . "
 I never thought it 'd be this hard . 
" We get more cases than we have available inspectors . It was the screams of the girl , twelve reports , that got us interested in one Stanley Colville . "
 The reports would flood in on full moon nights . All the crazies come out with the full moon . This guy was no different . Probably beat the poor girl on those nights . 
 So I waited . Pulled up in my beater one such night . Knocked on the door . 
 A shotgun answered . 
 That 's when my heart dropped . 
 `` CPS ? '' 
" I nodded , could n't speak through the solid lump of concrete building in my throat . I could feel the tiniest bit of pee leak out too . "
 `` Come in . '' 
 He motioned me inside with the shotgun . 
 One thing I learned growing up in the Midwest : never argue with the man with a twelve gauge . 
 So I entered . 
 `` Follow me . '' 
" He was toting the shotgun as we made our way down the clean hallway , nothing out of the ordinary in this house . Pictures of a smiling teen with her father lined the walls , normal decor , television with the news running in a clean living room . "
 No obvious signs of bad parenting . Except that damn shotgun . 
 He was wearing a pistol on his hip too and a knife in a sheath on his thigh . 
 Guy was absolutely nuts . 
 `` Basement . '' 
" I took one quick look . Colville was a decent looking guy , clean shaven and well dressed . Fit . Normal looking guy . "
 That was about to cut me up into little pieces in his basement . 
 Great . 
" Into the dark I took the steps down , coming to a heavy steel door with padlocks and bolts . I could hear heavy breathing behind the door . "
 A chill ran down my spine . Maybe she was n't abused . Maybe she was the abuser . 
" From a ring of keys he unlocked the padlocks , unbolted the chains , and opened the door on oiled hinges . "
 Inside was a concrete room with three heavy metal rings secured to the floor . Through these were looped heavy steel chains . These in turn were attached to manacles . 
" These in turn were attached to the furry arms of a vicious looking beast , drooling and slobbering and eyeing me with obvious hunger . "
" There was a pink bed against the wall , some posters on the walls , and a stack of books on a nightstand next to the bed . Teen fiction . "
 Shit . 
 `` What the FUCK ! '' I shouted as it hit me . 
 He nodded . 
 `` Werewolf . '' 
 From there I do n't remember much . I remember the concrete rushing up towards me and then blackness . 
" I think I passed out .
`` Dave ? It 's me , mom . '' My hands shivered slightly . "
" `` Hey ma , why are you calling me so late ? '' I checked the clock . It was late . 10:00 pm late . "
" `` I just wanted to see if you remembered to pick up your gramma 's medicine . She needs it tonight and tomorrow morning , you know . '' I could feel his hands crushing the phone . I would too , if I was him . He volunteered to get my mother off my hands , a huge relief for me . "
" But as much of a burden my mother is , she is still mom . His grandmother . I had a gut feeling she was about to die . "
" `` Did you give her the medicine yet , Dave ? She also needs some money for bingo night , every Friday , make sure you drive her there tomorrow . '' I covered the microphone a little to hide my gulp . Through the speaker I can hear his panting . Dave always panted when furious . "
" `` Yes . Gave it to her right after dinner . '' He spoke a little fast . I trust my son , but I feel as if he was lying . What can I do , bed ridden like this ? "
" `` Thanks , Dave . Thanks a lot . '' "
 `` Sure . '' A small sigh followed his seemingly genuine reassurance . 
" `` Good night , go- ” "
" `` Good night . '' He hastily ended the call . Teary eyed and slightly depressed , I whispered to the phone , hoping desperately for someone to tell him what I said . "
" `` Good luck , Dave . I love you . '' "

It 's quiet , living on the edge of town I manage to get away from the hustle and grind of the cyber city Teletariam . It was the first city that really embraced technology and set the standard for how cities needed to change and grow in the late 21st century . Cities across the globe had been integrating and modifying their cities but lacked the proper planning and initiative to effectively implement the modern marvels . "
" Teletariam changed that , being built East of Denver Colorado at the foot of the hills it served to be a beacon of new life . The series of revolutionary wars that occurred across the country from 2058-2093 left the country more united and stronger then ever , but beaten down and rebuilding . Teletariam was built as the new capital of the United West and served as the most technologically advanced city to ever be produced . We of the West take pride knowing that it stands tall , a symbol of our rebuilding , devotion and resilience . "
" My name is Gabriel and I work outside of this modern Haven as a farmer . They city produces most of its food internally but I grow larger row crops that not only support citizens but are used in various manufacturing processes . It 's a Tuesday and like every Tuesday I get up feed the dogs while I power up and prep my cropbots for the day . I watched the news on a heads up display when I felt it . The ground shaking as if the world itself wanted to rip apart . I ran outside and the sun was eclipsing a large object in the sky ? The shaking changes from a violent shift to a rumbling , I can feel it in my chest . A sense of panic runs through my veins , what is going on . An attack from the east , southern rebels , or something else ? "
" With out a second to waste I ran through my shop , grabbing my binoculars , up the spiral stairs to my overlook I look toward the sky , it 's a ship . Something I have never seen before , it is huge , coated in silver with orange accents . It eclipsed the sun , taken back from how big it is I look below large vessels had landed on the surface and something is heading this way . "
 Peering through my binoculars I can not believe what I see ... . 
 Horses ... 
 Unbelievable ... 
" But who is riding them , or what ? "
" These horses are bigger then anything I have ever seen before . Plated in armor covering all their vital and soft spots , I can see the breath burn from there nostrils as they gallop towards me . The riders appear to be wearing silver armor and a Lance blazing like the fire of a thousands sun 's . "
" What am I looking at ? As I took in the display off my overlook , over my head flies a legion carrier of the United West Marine corps . They land 500 meters from my shop right on my ready to harvest crops . A batallian of troops , tanks , troop transports , heavy gunners and equipment rolls off and into the ready . Without wasting time the heavy gunners and tanks begin to fire long range rounds . I watch as the rounds strike the horses and there riders , but to my and the soldiers on the ground surprise there is no effect . The barrage stops and the soldiers appear to be regrouping . "
" Suddenly jets fly over head along with a c730 air cannon ship . Hell begins to rain down as the jets bomb and lay down aggressive fire . The c370 lays down hundreds of thousands of rounds with in seconds . The approach of the unknown enemy is unaltered and an uneasiness rises across the battlefield . Seasoned soldiers from the war began to bark at the marines , rallying them to get ready to make a stand . You can hear the horses breathing hard . They 're getting close . The soldiers deploy the trenchers , digging trenches instantly . They jump in preparing to hold there defensive line . "
 The enemy approaches at about 150 meters all at once the riders draw there swords and suddenly the horses accelerate running all out . They are met by a barrage of bullets . Within seconds they are on top of the marines break through their line . Chopping and stabbing as they go . Most of the horses cleared the trench and the riders jumped into the trenches as blood flies everywhere . 
" I stand in astonishment , in front of me I have just witnessed a bloody violent confrontation and as I realize what I had just seen , that 's when I see it . A young Marine who has confronted a rider . "
" The riders horse appears to have misjudged the trench and took a spill breaking its neck the marine fires on the downed rider and the shots hit his armor without penetration . The marine changes to incinerator rounds and fires . To no effect , the rider gets its senses and begins to stand . It is just over 2 meters tall and stands on its 2 feet . "
" Its clearly not from this planet but it resembles us . The rider rushes the marine . Within a second it has pushed its blade through the marines chest . But in the marines right hand he held his dagger and with his last bit of strength he plunged it into the riders neck .
Wow , just want to say this is the best prompt I 've seen in the many months I 've been reading WP responses . It does n't seem like the kind that will take off , but good job on thinking of it . "

" Ray Thompson lay with his cheek pressing on the scorching desert sand , arm stretched desperately towards a water skin . His bare chest burned with each shift in the grains as he inched closer to the leather . Running a dry tongue over cracked lips , the large man used all his strength to push himself the final bit of distance . He grabbed the water skin and pulled his arm back like he 'd been bitten by a cobra . "
" Ray managed to roll onto his back and put the smooth skin to his lips . Only a few drops fell into his mouth , but they were Godsend . He closed his eyes in bliss and felt his tongue re-moisten like the old sponge his mother used to wash the dishes . He felt something else fall into his open mouth . "
" Six individual pricks moved down the roof of his mouth and into his throat . Ray rolled back to his stomach and began choking , trying to loosen the intruding ... whatever it was . He managed to get to his knees , feeling adrenaline kick in , and coughed violently . He felt his chest expand and retract with each cough like a drum when beat . The six points made their way down his throat , into his esophagus . He felt the points move individually , but as one . Perhaps a scorpion . "
" He got a deep itch from inside of his body . Ray brought up a hand and punched himself in the chest , right over the itch . He felt the hits connecting , but no pain from them . He was either too weak to punch properly or too close to death to feel the pain . "
" As he began to panic , a sharp pinch came from his chest . Ray 's eyes widened as he tried to scream , but he did n't hear any noise come out . He had n't heard any noise for ... days ? When did he come out here , anyway ? "
" Ray shook his head as he found his thoughts wandering . The pain in his chest spread outward , as though a sun had been born within it . "
" He felt a sudden grasp inside of him let go . Perhaps the scorpion fell into his stomach , made itself food for him . Ray smiled , snickering in the heat . "
" All this time , he had been starving , but could n't take care of it . He fell back to his hands and knees , laughing hysterically , though the sound of his laughter did n't reach his ears . "
" All this time he could n't eat , so the food walked *into* his mouth ! "
" Randy ... Ra ... Ray ! Ray held his stomach and fell face first into the sand , feeling the burn on his eyelids as he continued laughing . "
 It walked into his mouth ! 
" Ray fell back to the sand , laughing helplessly as the sun climbed the sky . "
 Perhaps this would finally be it .

Hans was never a “ bright ” child by any measure . He scored average in just about every capacity : IQ , grades , sports . Everything he tried , he was *average* . His parents didn ’ t really know what to do with him . He was now 8 years old , had a few friends , never really exhibiting talents or a profinity for anything . On a whim his father purchased a stuffed dragon , roughly the size of an average baby . It was a vibrant green color , deep like an emerald yet just as brilliant . It had horns resembling a reindeer ’ s , and a pearly white beard under its chin . Its body was long and slender like a snakes , yet girthy enough to hold and hug . The day his father gave him Sam , is a day he ’ ll never forget . "
" Hans sat there , playing with the few toys he had as his father called his attention . He looked up to see Sam placed right before him . At first he was confused . It was a weekday and usually weekends were the time for gifts and treats . Maybe he did something special the day before , he wasn ’ t usually aware of these things and often forgot his own actions . Now all his attention was transfixed on the wonderfully verdant creature before him . He reached out to hold his new companion , “ Wait , what do you say , Hans ? ” "
" “ Thanks , daddy. ” "
 “ You ’ re welcome . Have you decided his name yet ? ” his father asked as he handed Hans the plush animal . 
 “ Sam. ” 
" His father sighed . He thought he might provoke some hidden creativity in the boy , alas it was the name of a family dog who died a year prior of old age . After a few weeks , his father would grow to like the name and almost regard fictional creature as a household pet . Hans brought Sam with him everywhere : school , bed , trips to the doctor , even church despite the protests of his mother . His father saw that it wasn ’ t about what Sam did with the toy , it was the connection he made with his inanimate friend . Soon , they began to see Hans use Sam in imaginary play , something that eluded Hans previously . Sam had a whole family , Hans would tell his parents , that lived on Jupiter ( they were learning about the solar system that week ) and used special walkie talkies to communicate to Earth . Hans couldn ’ t understand Sam ’ s language , but he would read Sam ’ s facial expressions and could tell if the conversation was good or bad . He picked this up when his parents were talking , thinking he couldn ’ t hear or see them . "
" Then , he started drawing . And painting . By the time Hans was 12 , he moved on to more difficult mediums like pastel and oil . His parents were not only impressed , but thrilled . Their son actually *was* talented . It was a shame when he got sick and couldn ’ t paint anymore . Hans ’ health started to deteriorate around his 14th birthday . His parents first noticed his lack of energy , then it evolved into notes from his teachers that he was sleeping in class . Eventually , his symptoms grew to frequent migraines , crippling him from attending school or even leaving his bed . Sam was constantly by his side , Hans even refused to let his mother give him his monthly washing . It didn ’ t take long for a diagnosis , a malignant brain tumor that was spreading quickly . Sometimes these things happen for no reason , the doctor told his parents , there ’ s not much they can do besides surgery and immediate treatment . Treatment meant chemotherapy , which his mother already went through with her mother . She was reluctant at first , but because of the doctor ’ s ushering - she relented . "
" It was a warm summer day in early June when Hans went in for his weekly chemotherapy treatment . During the summer , his treatments were in the morning so he could have the remainder of the day to paint . At least , he would try to paint . Nausea and fatigue would usually follow his treatments confining him to his bed most days . The gentle breeze kissed his naked forehead , partially covered by a baseball cap to mask his bald head . He liked to keep the windows down when they drove , the wind helped cool his face and keep him from vomiting . As they pulled into the hospital parking lot , Hans clutched Sam to his chest . Sometimes the nurses wouldn ’ t let him bring Sam in , today they promised he could join him . As he approached the hospital doors , Hans got nauseous and had to stop for minute . He considered running away , far from the hospital so he didn ’ t have to go back . He was old enough to know that it wasn ’ t possible . He wasn ’ t strong enough . "
" Once they got to the treatment room , Hans noticed there weren ’ t any other patients . Usually there were a few , but he was the only teenager . There was another kid he would talk to sometimes , but he passed away a month prior from leukemia . His dad dropped him off
‘ …and we ’ ll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight . The time is six-fifty-five , and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’ "
" The daily news blares over the radio . Light rolls through the curtains . I turn over in bed . Just another Monday morning . Minutes pass , and I hear all the familiar sound . Cars on the road outside . My flatmates stirring in their rooms . The world is waking up . "
" I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom . I like it that way . Every night I open the my window , to let the night in . Every morning the chill startles me awake . I open the curtains , look out onto the street . The usual crowd waltz down the street , going wherever it is they go . Someone glances up at my window , and hurriedly looks away as they realise I ’ m half naked . "
" As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot . A small , folded piece of paper on the floor . My name is written on it , in my own handwriting . I pick it up , scrutinise it . I don ’ t remember writing this . I open it , and read the words inside . "
" *Act normally , otherwise they ’ ll notice . * "
 I ’ m confused . I really don ’ t recall writing this . What does it mean ? Who are ‘ they ’ ? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door . My flatmate . 
" ‘ Huney , are you ok in there ? You 'll be late. ’ "
" I look at the note again . And hesitate . <newline>
Vibrations ! Vibrations and light . That was the key！ I mean it all goes back to Einstein right ? e=mc squared。 "
" And when you think about it , everything really is just a different form of vibration : energy waves , an objects wave function in space-time , the vibration of atoms and their vibrating strings . "
" Once I understood that it was all about getting the right vibration of sound and light . Then the mirrors would liquefy and form an Einstein-Rosen bridge of sorts , literally a gateway to another universe . "
" But suppose I did n't really think things through though ... . I mean I was baffled when it worked , and even more baffled to learn that each mirror leads to its own separate universe ! "
" And of course everything that happens here happens in unison there , so you ca n't really just expect to walk on in , there is another you in the way , mimicking your movements , thoughts , speech patterns etc , all in exact unison . Even shaking hands is impossible . "
 And do n't even get me started on the dullness of the conversations ! 
" `` Oh Hey there ! I 'm from earth , wait , you are too . Oh , were saying the same exact thing at the same exact time are n't we ? Wait ... what am I thinking now ? Last night 's movie ! His acting was n't that good was it ? Wow ... we are literally speaking the same exact words at the same time , it is like we share a brain ... .. no ... . its like we are the same person ... wow this kinda sucks ... '' "
 So my dream of entering in was quickly abandoned . As was my dream of having a good conversation with an opponent as studied as myself . But hey ! At least we can still send objects through ! 
" In fact , I am actually eating toast from another universe ! ... ... but ... . it tastes and looks exactly like the toast I sent through ... so maybe it is n't really all that interesting ... . Or even all that useful ... "
" Maybe I wo n't be getting that Nobel Peace Prize after all ...
Life feeds life . All living things feast on the lives of others . It is the way of the universe . It is possible to cultivate life , to let it grow , become a larger food source , which many do . So as they expanded and grew , they , too created life . It is also true that created life sometimes acknowledges this , and perceives their creation as divine . They devote their lives to appease this creator , but its their death which does so . "
" With each death , the creator is fed . It 's all about how one cultivates the life . If unchecked , or done incorrectly , the food can rot , or even attempt to attack its creator . Some food even becomes parasitic , but it all turns out okay in the end . "
" This life will grow , and as it reaches the point of becoming too big to contain , then , and only then , will the growth be cut completely , and the creator can have a feast worthy to be called 'Divine . '
`` Can you hook me up ? '' <newline> I looked at the kid in front of me , he was , with a liberal guess , fifteen . But he was obviously resourceful , he managed to find me in this haunted city . "
" `` Well , it depends on what you want . '' I said . "
 `` I want a *discern . * '' 
" *Discern* . Ah . That was an expensive item , because of the nature of it . You could rifle through anyone 's head . It was also an extremely uncommon find . What did a fifteen year old want a discern for ? "
 `` Why ? '' 
" `` It 's getting you money , you do n't really need to know . '' He gripped his armrests and seemed extremely angry at the question . "
" `` Hey , buddy . How about you cool your tone and answer the question . '' I said . Stupid children . They always underestimate while simultaneously overestimate the raw power of commands . "
" `` Well , there 's a girl , and I do n't know if she likes me or not . '' He said , with a straight face . "
 I laughed . Hard . I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face . I finally retained my composure and I looked up at the kid . He looked very unsettled . 
" `` What are you willing to give me for it ? '' I asked , at last . "
" `` Well , my grandpa said he 's willing to give up his , but you have to give him *overpower* too . '' The boy replied . "
" `` What is his word ? '' I said , wondering what could be so esoteric that his grandfather thought he could get two of such powerful commands . "
 `` Enchant . '' 
" `` Deal , bring him here and I 'll do it . '' I said , greedily . Enchant was a big deal , especially for a salesman like myself . I 've only seen three in the wild , and no one was willing to sell . This must be a special case . "
" `` Hey , son . '' I said , before right before he walked out the door . "
" `` Yeah ? '' He asked , turning around . "
" `` Why does your grandfather want the *overpower* , instead of *enchant* ? '' "
" `` He has cancer . He 's hoping to *overpower* it . '' He said , and he left . "
" I sat down and poured a drink . Today was a good day . Saving a life , getting *enchant* , only losing one of my two overpowers , and a discern . "
" I loved being born with *transfer . * <newline>

" Monotony was something that I loathed , hated with a passion . At 7:04am , I would be in my car driving to the train station . I would catch the 7:19am into the city , and be at work around 9:00 . I 'd sit at my cubicle typing away at the assorment of keys ( mostly the backspace button ) . I leave at 5:00pm , get on the train , drive back home , eat my dinner , and crash into bed . Day after day this routine happened . It never left me , it never entertained me , it never did anything but just be . "
 I would have agreed with anyone who said that sounds boring . I would have said that I rather be doing anything other than that . 
" <newline> I crossed by the monkey paw on my walk up to the train station from my car . There 's this dirt path that was once paved , but my town decided it was more important to buy new speed bumps to help `` save the children '' . Pretty sure that the children were already `` saved '' but now I need this damn town to fix my sanity . "
" It looked like a hairy hand , just peeking out from the bushes . I though it was just Buck Landon 's , our town drunk . Every town has one of those , right ? Maybe the community could choose to `` save the drunkards '' . So I went to check on him , but ended up with a monkey paw . Why was a monkey paw just lying in the bushes ? That probably should have been one of my wishes . "
" Speaking of wishes , somehow this monkey paw granted 5 . Probably should have spent another wish asking how the fuck a monkey paw has magical powers . I ended up wishing for the stereotypical things . The things that would take me away from the roads of monotony . But do n't be fooled , wishes do n't come without consequences . "
 You wo n't be in my situation dealing with being in a hospital with incompetent fucks not being able to decide whose going to help you . 
" `` No I insist , you have so much more skill and talent . `` "
" `` No , No , you are much more capable in communicating with the patient ! '' "

 <newline> How is my favorite man-thing ? Are you really three heads and a hand tall now ? I can hardly believe it ! Pretty soon you 'll be devouring planets while the priests of this world and that one beg for oblivion .

" <newline> Just the other day I was summoned by a Shade Priest who lives near you and thought I might perchance come visit . He was such an epic fail ( am I using that right ? ) . He was so obsessed with collecting the bones of all his ancestors that I barely had time to even try to contact you . In the end he tried to bind me to him so I twisted his face . Now wanders the night in a blindness interrupted only by the snapping mouths that now live behind his eye lids . If you see him , just say you 're watched by me and he should flee in unfathomable fear . I did get a chance to stop by , but I think you were out of town . "
" <newline> Tell your neighbor I 'm sorry about his birds , but it was largely his fault . I can hardly be blamed for the darkness that dwells within them , or that the amount of darkness is commensurate to the misery he lays on them , or that they are annoying . "

To put it politely , today has been a long day . There are some other words I would add to that , but the promise of $ 200 dollars is hard to resist . Staying up all night to cram for the two hardest finals of my academic career ( so far ) was bad enough . Running into my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend celebrating being done with finals when I tried to run into Quicki ’ s for a snack between finals was bad enough . Getting urgent calls from my mom asking for $ 50 ( that I don ’ t have ) in order to pay her phone bill in the middle of my second final was bad enough . Having all of that happen today , the last day of my stupid bet with Colin , was more than bad enough , but to make matters worse , ten feet from getting to my dorm and a well deserved nap , I stepped in doggie-doo . "
" All of that was bad enough , so when I opened the door to my dorm and heard a crowd of people shout , “ Happy birthday , Timothy ! ” I was less than impressed . I stared the group down for a moment , my eyes glancing over their faces trying to see someone I recognized from a class or one of Colin ’ s stupid clubs . No , these were fresh faces imported from Colin ’ s jerkosphere of local friends . "
" “ Sorry , wrong person guys . And maybe wrong room too . There ’ s only me and Colin here , ” I said as politely as I could muster . Hopefully I had said that loud enough that they all got the message . <newline> The man in front , a large , but lanky dude replied , “ What are you talking about Timothy ? You don ’ t want to celebrate your birthday ? ” "
" He had a mischievous grin on his face that I wanted to smack off . He lifted a bottle of Grey Goose and begin pouring shots for the whole room . I sighed , throwing off my shoes , careful to let the dog poo land on Colin ’ s side and dropped my bag on my desk . At a glance , the amount of alcohol they had must have cost enough to add up to more than the $ 200 I would get once the clock struck midnight . But I knew Colin , he wasn ’ t the type to lose , even if it meant blowing much more than we originally bid . I mean , the amount only got that high after we went double or nothing several times . Either way I was n't planning on cursing before I got my money . "
" “ It ’ s a surprise you all fit in here , ” I muttered . Our room was supposed to be a quad , but both of our other roommates had conveniently dropped out midway through the semester to go find themselves together . I suppose it was possible they were actually looking for one of my ex-roommates . "
" “ Hey , I don ’ t know if Colin put you all up to this or something , but check it : Colin ’ s out trying to hit it one last time before break , Chris is driving down Route 66 or something , and Joe ’ s close behind . I ’ m Troy , I ’ m tired , and I ’ d love if you all took this outside. ” "
" A pretty cut dude who felt comfortable wearing a tank-top and flip-flops , Boston ’ s winter be damned , put an arm on my shoulder and said calmly , “ Hey man , we ’ re here for you . Chill out and grab a drink . We ’ re celebrating that ’ s it ’ s finally , the day. ” "
" I really don ’ t like being touched . Not at all . It ’ s not like I was abused or anything , I just hate the feeling of another person touching me without notice . I shoved his arm off of me and said , “ Hey dude , that ’ s great and all , but how about you find another dorm room to mess - ” "
" “ Tim , stop fucking around , ” a gorgeous blonde chick interrupted . Her voice was somewhere between heavenly and melodic . She grabbed my arm , and dragged me towards a futon . “ Finals are over . Drink up ! ” "
" My better judgement said this was a trap , but my sleep-deprived brain deferred to private first class on this one . I took the shot glass from her and mumbled something about them having the wrong guy , but decided I would have Colin ’ s liquor and his money . There was a lot of cheering and hand-clapping when they realized I was going to be drinking as well . Good luck getting me to talk though . "
 “ Let ’ s get ratchet ! ” some chubby dude in the corner screamed jumping on a desk . 
" “ Yeah , you do that ! ” I yelled back . All of my important stuff was already in storage . This was Colin ’ s idea anyway and he was rich , right ? "
" So for the next few hours we drank , ate pizza , and made way too much noise . It seemed like there was an intense debate on whether we should be playing poppy-stuff , heavy hip-hop , or some EDM music
`` Oh , come on . Everyone can do something . Chrissake , Jim hamboned for his talent , and that 's just crap . You 've * got ta * be able to do something cool '' . <newline> Truth was , though , I never really tried anything before really . I never was interested in art or music , and never had any athleticism either . I was n't any good at juggling , I was an OK cook at best , and really could n't hum , let alone sing . About the only thing I really excelled at was work , and how demanding was it to run an industrial paper shredder ? "
" <newline> `` Really , I ca n't think of anything Steve , '' I protested . `` I did n't even sign up for this stupid seminar . '' "
" <newline> `` Well , none of us did . Stupid 'team building ' programs suck . We all get along , do n't we ? '' Steve protested . `` Come on , just get up and like , I dunno , hop on one leg in a circle . Anything to get this over with . '' "
" <newline> `` Is someone still shy ? '' asked the coordinator . `` Come one , everyone has something unique to contribute ! Let 's see how this star **shines ! ** '' "
" <newline> `` God , all right , '' I grumbled . `` Ummmm ... '' <newline> `` We believe in you ! '' our smarmy little manager said . `` Do n't let us all down in front of the veep ! '' <newline> `` Ugh , fine . I guess I got this little trick I do to take out the trash , but I do n't think it really impressive . Um . Anyone got some trash they need to get rid of ? '' "
" <newline> `` Yeah , my last performance review ! '' someone shouted from the back , followed by a smattering of laughter . Oh , what a riot we were . "
" <newline> `` OK , there 's a trash can ; thanks Cindy . All right , everyone watch , here we go , '' I said as I pushed the trash away . `` Yeah , not very impressive , I know , '' I mumbled to silence . And more silence . Finally , it got uncomfortable . `` What ? You wanted me to participate ; I never said it was a *good* talent , OK ? '' "
" <newline> `` How did you do that , '' whispered Jeff , our VP of operations . `` What did you do ? '' "
" <newline> `` What ? I just , you know , pushed it away . '' "
 <newline> `` Away ? Away from what ? ! '' 
 <newline> `` You know ; away from everything . '' 
" <newline> `` What , like , everything ? All at once ? '' "
 <newline> `` Well ... yeah . Saves me a ton of time on taking out the trash . '' 
" <newline> `` Son , '' said Jeff , `` screw this seminar . We need to talk about your new raise , and that little bit of magic you can do . '' <newline>

It was when I realized that I would live that I was really scared to death .
**Odyssey of the Edrathi : A 'Home ' At Last ? ** "
" Our homeworld is long dead , and few of us remain . There were many `` flotilla fleets '' like ours , although what has become of them , who can say ? Do the people of Ukrub still number in the millions at least , or are the 437,521 survivors in our fleet all that remain of our race ? Even with the tetradrives to travel a lightyear in the span of a month , it would take centuries to properly contact the other fleets , and who 's to say we would ever receive an answer ? "
" Years of rotating individuals between waking work and cryosleep , the prohibition of bearing children except in extreme circumstances , the reclamation of any and all resources onboard our ships , all to keep us going until we found another planet to settle . We found such a world through the telescopes , the closest world brimming with life in our otherwise barren sector , and set up a string of jumps towards that planet . As we drew ever closer , however , we were able to see the clustered lights on the nightside , and learned that we were indeed not alone in this cold unforgiving universe . We had been given new hopes and fears in a single stroke , for while it was a world harbouring an alien intelligence , we knew so little about the pale , gaunt creatures that trotted about without claws or tails , only their deformed spines and lanky legs enabling them to walk upright . "
" As we crossed into the heliosphere into the system , a translation project was started up to dissect and analyse the wild and blurry transmissions echoing forth from that noisy little garden , and we found something most intriguing . Many of the transmissions were spoken in a similar language to that heard in the Book of Rush , many of the words spoken lining up to the words of the lead singer on the original holographic tapes . This planet , could it be `` Erth '' ? Could these tall furless beings be the Elda race of Mann ? In our efforts to survive the destruction of Ukrub , had we stumbled upon the birthplace of the gods ? "
" Even with this grand revelation , we were yet again surprised when we intercepted quite an intriguing signal , what seemed to be a binary transmission of sorts , 3217 octobits in size . The signal continued for exactly 252 seconds before it stopped , and the second we had the complete message our engineers set about trying to decipher it . By freak chance , one of them arranged it into 111 rows , each row being 28 units long , and found what appeared to be a vertical series of blocky pictograms . "
" What we noticed first was that this world appeared to operate on Base-12 , seemingly due to how their paws had 5 digits as opposed to our 4 . I remember counting the digits on their paws , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 . Then I counted mine , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 10 . Creepy , but made a surprising amount of sense . Then came the second collection of numbers , 1 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 17 . We lined them up to the atomic numbers of the 5 elements essential for genetic molecules , and lo and behold the third section of the message showed representations of molecular formulae for every nucleotide present in the genetic code , followed by a symbol of the double helix and what appeared to be 37,775,775,536 base pairs , roughly the size of our own genome though possibly exaggerated . Maybe it was an early approximate on their part ? "
" The following sections depicted the Elda , in height and in population , then the worlds in their system , for some reason counting a very small dwarf world we found to be rather rich in nitrogen ice with pockets of frozen methane , and finally what appeared to be a radio telescope , presumably the source of the signal . With the project wrapped up , we continued our voyage past the gas giants and through that asteroid belt of theirs , until the remains of our fleet , all 437,521 refugees on board , came into orbit around an Erth mysteriously devoid of major space structures . There were an abundance of satellites , yes , and a small collection of pods and panels that constituted a rather primitive space station , but beyond that we were left quite confused . "
" Through surface scans we were able to see the sprawling metropolises of the Elda race , and there were undoubtedly people in great abundance , but they appeared transfixed by something . Some were glued to their media devices , while others stared up into the infinite skies , but all shared similar expressions . Unease , anxiety , fear , excitement , emotions we had gleaned from their visual transmissions en-route to Erth . Some great tragedy , we presumed , as we scanned for areas far from the cities , suitable zones to land and establish our colonies . After all , if they were n't using the wild spaces , surely they would not object to a race in need making efficient use of the land , right ? How naive we were ... "
" At first , our colonies remained safe and the colonists rejoiced in the free air , drinking deep of natural waters and finally breeding freely as
Time stands still , and he appears . Deaths robes licked the cold tile as he entered the room to claim his latest victim . Darkness flowed from them onto the floor like a mist , shrouding his movements as he shifted his frame towards the hospital bed . "
" He allowed his eyes to rest for a moment on the young woman that lie there . Golden blonde hair , rose colored cheeks , icy blue eyes . How unfortunate she must feel at this moment , how awful to be her . Her husband collapsed on the white tile floor next to her , the pain of loss must have been terrible for him . Death had , of course seen this before , many times . But in cases like this , he could not help himself from feeling an amount of regret and empathy for the departings kin . The world was not fair , not right , but it was not for him to decide , he had a job to do . Death claims all , no matter the circumstances . "
" His victim lie still , and death looked on . A stillborn baby , the very opposite of himself , yet still the very essence of himself . Here is what should have been life . What should have been happiness . But the world was not fair , not right , and he had a job to do , it was not for him to decide . He reached for the young soul and grasped it gently . "
" He paused for a brief moment and felt the warmth from the soul on his bone like fingers . `` You are young and do not know sadness or joy , and so this may mean little to you but , I do not wish to claim you . '' The souls warmth remained . Death felt a small pulsation coming from it . It glowed a warm hue of the purest golden white , untainted by the years of hurt that life brings . He looked at the small body in which it came from , fragile and motionless . "
" `` I will watch you closely , little soul . I expect great things in return for this , '' Deaths voice rumbled deeply as he reached out to the stillborn child 's body a second time . `` not everyone gets a second chance at life , but everyone deserves a first chance . '' "
" Death released the warm , vibrant soul back to where it came , and glided back to the door . `` Until we meet again , little one . '' he said . "
" As he made his exit from the room , he could hear the child 's first gasp of air , followed by a cry . The world may not be fair , not right , but today Death respected life . He would watch over this one , to see what good his empathy brought the world of fragile men . <newline>
They say you die of old age with black blood . Not that I 've ever seen an autopsy done before . Born with white blood and gets darker with every sin , or thats what they say . Im kinda a sceptic , could be a strange corralation . My blood the few short times a year I see it is kinda looks like a flavored coffee creamer last I saw it . But sitting right in front of me is the love of my life the sweetest person I know with a nose bleed , that is way beyond the fifty shades of grey or brown that late life blood usually is . Shes not even embarrassed , even though I 'm a sceptic this is mad unusual . She tells me that she does n't believe in sin and that morals are created by man . That this blood turning is guilt that maybe she could do something better . Or maybe for not giving people a second chance . This all seems way to rehearsed to be the full story . When we get home for the night I ask if she murdered someone half jokingly , she gets mad that I 'm just like the rest believing these myths not actually believing in the science , or even science may have a possibility to explain this . "
" Now let 's go on to as why she 's saying this is a myth and why I 'm not running out on her . In the beginning there was Adam and Eve . The creator told Adam not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge for you shall surely die on this day . Adam tells Eve do not touch that tree of knowledge for you shall surely die . The first sin or so they say a little white lie told from husband to wife . So the snake was born Vushu . Vushu convinced Eve to touch the tree and got her to eat the forbidden fruit . She then fed it to Adam and the creator says you shall surely die on this day but a day is a thousand years so your new punishments will be : must work the fields , painful childbirth , and your blood will coagulate ( not a real translation just a modern one ) like a snake bite . For the snake is sin and you have created it with you tongue . Well this fable is passed down for around 36 generations at 2400 years . Where the creator chooses a people in front of what the book says 600,000 males . Which that story is only written a hundred or so years later following the Messiah and promised eternal glory . But the Messiah events were only recorded 700 years later and 200 years after his death . "
" Ok now here 's the fun part this fable did n't even happen on this planet apparently it happened on earth which good destroyed due to man kinds black blood . We are on Mars just seven generations after earth 's destruction . They say we will be saved when earth settles and we will be repopulated . But being the sceptic I am I agree with my girlfriend I think we were responsible for our actions , and earth 's demise . "
" I kiss my girlfriend on the cheek maybe you ca n't take a joke that 's why you 've got black blood .
`` Happy Birthday , Lucifer . '' "

 `` Or ?

Life on the reservation was miserable . Poverty , crime and corruption ran rampant , and day-to-day life was much harder than it should be . Growing up , Steven learned about the White Man , who had come under the guise of peace and slaughtered his people , stole their land and herded them into these godforsaken hovels . Steven swore he would help his people . He spurned the guidance of his elders and their suggestion that he become an attorney or a civic leader , or an activist . Instead , Steven gravitated toward the myths and Gods of his ancestors , praying every day for a way to restore glory to the Cherokee nation . <newline> As Steven got older , he had *visions . * In one , an eagle carried him across the ocean , dropping him in a faraway land where his people dwelled , hunting and living off the land . There were no cars , no smog , no white man . In another vision , a huge grey wolf carried him through the forest and into a reservation , but here there were only white men , and they lived as he did , stumbling through the life he had always known . The Gods had been good to him . They had given him a name , Spirit Traveler , and they gave him purpose ; he knew what he must do , but how ? <newline> One day , as Steven was sitting in the smoke hut , meditating on his myths and gods , he had his most vivid vision . He stood facing the fire , the wolf and the eagle across from him on either side . The wolf growled and snarled , baring his fangs . The eagle spread his wings wide , raising his beak to the sky . A powerful voice resonated in his head . <newline> `` CHOOSE , '' it told him , `` Spirit Traveler , you must make your choice between the fearsome wolf or the powerful eagle . '' "
" Spirit Traveler felt a deep hollowness in his chest , a great fear of the beasts before him . As he cowered back , the wolf spoke in a low rumble : `` You do not have to fear me . '' The eagle replied in a piercing shriek `` You do not have to fear anything ! '' "
" He clenched his fists . What path should he take ? He stepped forward , swallowing the lump in his throat . He reached out and made his choice . "
" The feast was underway when he opened his eyes . He saw the long tables , his proud , lithe ancestors sitting across from the pudgy white men in their ridiculous black and white costumes . His ancestors were so strong ; he had never seen a native so full of confidence and power . He was overwhelmed ; he could not imagine how these people could have been so easily and so thoroughly overrun by the much weaker white men . "

I rebuttoned my jeans up as I made my way back through the great city of Rome . I was n't worried about being seen by the locals , the cloaking would take care of that . For all they knew there was nobody walking down the street with a freshly sucked dick and a smile as big as the colosseum . "
" The rendezvous site was between two pillars , I would meet Jeremy there and we would go back to the future . We 'd been paired up as time buddies , making sure that neither of us tried to stay . There was a big deal at Two Timers about paradoxes , but I was n't paying much attention to that . "
" We 'd built up quite the bond during our time together as Time buddies , we would discuss how things went if we were going to look for a new girl , our lives at home . I spent an hour every three days with the man , so he and I had become fast friends , and we had made a pact to make every Wednesday from this day on blowjob day . "
" We chatted for a moment before being wrapped up in the time stream , a nice blue middle area between times . It was where the HQ of Two Timers was . At the helm today was Trisha , who was looking over papers when we ported in . "
" `` Hi , Trish ! '' Jeremy said , he always left a big tip with her , and she usually redid the top button of her blouse when he left . "
" `` Hey Jeremy , '' she said , not looking up from her paperwork , `` 2056 right ? '' "
" `` That 's the year , '' I said with a smile , man it felt good to have someone who wanted you . "
" `` Sounds good , '' she tapped a few buttons and pressed the large red one , a large ERROR popped up on her screen , `` Ah shit , '' she said looking up to us , `` What did you guys do ? '' "
" `` We went and cheated on our wives , '' I said while rolling my eyes . "
" `` No , like , what exactly did you do ? '' "
" `` Well , '' Jeremy began , `` It 's blowjob Wednesday . '' "
" `` Blowjob , '' Trisha lost volume , `` Wednesday '' "
" `` Yeah , '' I said . "
" `` So did you fuck your partner ? '' She was looking at me with a panicked face , `` or did you just get a blowjob . '' "
 `` She blew me . '' 
" `` Motherfucker , '' she said , slamming her papers down , `` We send you back to FUCK hot chicks guys . '' "
 `` So ? '' 
" `` That sperm she swallowed was Emperor Nero , who was supposed to be born from you , '' she pointed at me , `` and now the timeline we are from does n't exist . '' "
" `` Fuck , '' I said grabbing my comb-over , `` What can we do about that ? '' "
" `` Well I ca n't send you back to the same day twice , '' she tapped her pen on her stack of papers , `` but there is a way that we can make this work . '' "
" `` How , we need to turn this around ! '' "
" `` If we change enough of the timeline that things end up extremely similar , we might be able to go to that timeline , '' she said looking at her papers , `` but you guys are going to need to fuck a lot of chicks . '' "
" `` I do n't know man , '' Jeremy turned to me , `` Are you up for this ? '' "
" `` Yeah , I think so , '' I said , looking down at my fly . It was time for the love hammer to bang this timeline back into place .

 One planet in the unimaginably vast universe has the perfect mix of chemicals and the right zap of energy at just the right point in time to bring life . Unique . 
" When scientists scanned every other planet and we realized that humanity was truly alone in a godless , lifeless universe everyone just lost it . The politicians in power met at the last UN summit in a somber tone making a decision for all of us , all of our kind , we could not bear it . Alone . "
" Finding a chemical mixture to attack the carbon chains and molecules of life on Earth was surprisingly easy , they released it into the atmosphere and we all watched as everything died . We have minutes left , every breath burns with the acid destroying us . "
" Alone in the Universe we were told by the scientists . They could find no one else .
The air in the room hangs dense with a sense of dread . Another day gone , another night present , another opportunity to let the feelings creep into her core . She sits at the edge of the bed , face damp , staring at the wooden floor underneath her feet . A lamp at the corner provides dim lighting . A fan overhead slowly turns , pressing air gently against her skin "
" She is a girl , probably the almost-perfect girl , who takes advantage of every minute of her youth . She is a girl who beams her smiles , tells her jokes , and laughs her laughs . She is a girl with plenty of friends , most would say , who sometimes come visit her in that room . "
" “ Why do you do this to yourself ? ” asks a voice , one quite close , laced with softness moreso than her own . "
" The girl continues to stare at the floor , her focus elsewhere . "
" “ Why ? ” the voice continues , even softer . It is quiet . That is not a question the girl knows the answer to . “ Want to know something ? ” "
" Reluctantly , the girl nods . "
 “ I care about you ” 
" The girl wipes part of her face with her forearm . She sniffles a bit , half believing the voice and half thinking it lies . "
" “ Do you want a hug ? ” asks the voice . Again , the girl barely manages a nod . “ Okay , good. ” "
" Warmth surrounds the girl and , after a few moments , it seeps into her core . It doesn ’ t expel the familiar sense of dread , but it gives it company . "
" “ Do you feel better ? ” she is asked . The girl shifts slightly in that bed and a breaks her gaze from the floor . Her mouth curls slightly . Not a smile , but almost . "
" “ Yeah , I do ” mutters the girl , almost to herself . “ A bit , at least ” "
" “ Good ” replied the voice , happier this time . “ You ’ re okay . Can you say that to yourself ? ” The words hang in the dense air in that room . "
 “ I can ” . She pauses . “ I ’ m okay ” 
 “ You ’ re okay ” quickly follows the voice . “ And I ’ m here for you ” 
" A slight smile paints itself onto the girl . She inhales deeply and slowly exhales , a sense of calm flowing through her . Another night about to end , another opportunity to see tomorrow . "
" She is a girl , far a from perfect , still with more time left in her youth . She is a girl who on the outside perhaps seems joyous , but no one has ever known her deeper than that . She is a girl , a lonely girl , which no one would say , and the only person in the room that night .
We still called ourselves humans , but bore little resemblence to our pre-ascendence ancestors . Their were still plenty of normal humans spread throughout the stars , but those of us who remained on Holy Terra had chosen a different path . After fighting long and hard to try and adapt the world we lived in to our needs , we had finally decided to simply adapt our needs to the world we lived in . We incorporated all the best traits of life found on Earth , and coded them into our genome . Our green skin now hinted at our ability to photosynethisize energy , ending hunger and removing the need for farming or hunting . We mostly lived in the forest , which had finally reclaimed much of what had formally called “ civilization ” . We also incorporated traits from our cetecean bretheren , allowing those who wished to return to the oceans where life on our world began , and learn the sagas sung by the elder whales . Our senses had been modified to detect colors and sounds our ancestors could only dream about , spurring an amazing renesseciance in the arts . We no longer needed the massive strength of our ancestors , and opted for smaller , lighter , more efficient bodies . With our bat-like ears , colored skin , and dimunitive nature , offworlders sometimes referred to us by the moniker “ elves ” . We did not mind their jesting , for we were finally at peace ; not only with our world , but with ourselves as well .
I remove my glasses to wipe off the sweat between my eyes . I 've been watching this little tutorial for ten minutes now . How long does it take to make a fucking sandwich ? "
" While her hands moved in slow-motion , she rambled endlessly about the history of the brand , from its New England roots to its present-day empire . Finally , she squatted down to examine the sandwich at eye level . `` Okay ! '' she squealed . `` Now that the tuna is spread evenly , we can prepare for the cheese . Now , we at Subway offer a variety of freshly-sliced cheeses . We carry American , Cheddar , Provolone , Feta , Mozzarella , Pepperjack , and Swiss , '' she said peppily , pointing to each respective wedge . `` Now , we cut them in isosceles triangles . If you place two of them next to each other like this , they fit nicely into a parallelogram . See ? I like to cover the entire base into cheese parallelograms . It just looks neater that way . '' "
" I take a moment to glance at my watch . Fifteen minutes . I better be getting a break soon . Meanwhile , her face is inches away from the sandwich . Without blinking , she places each slice of cheese onto the geometric pattern . She breathes a quiet sigh of relief after each successful placement . "
 `` It 's not going to collapse . It 's a sandwich . '' 
 She blinked and looked up at me innocently . 
 `` Sorry ? '' 
 `` You can get on with the demo . I know how to put cheese on a sandwich . '' 
 Her eyes began to well up with tears . 
" `` I 'm sorry , it 's just that I take so much pride in my work . This is my first job since Benny , my gerbil , died . Things are still rough . '' "
" I was lost for words . I mumbled an apology , yet she continued to stare at me hopefully . The persistent eye contact made me uncomfortable . I eventually gave into the silence . "
 `` Is there anything I can do ... to ... you know ... help ? '' I offered . 
 Her eyes lit up . 
" `` Yes , I am knee-deep in debt thanks to the whole funeral arrangement . Seriously , I ca n't even afford college . It 's like $ 20,000 a year . Times four years . Which is $ 80,000 . Plus room and board . '' "
 I looked at her incredulously . 
" `` So can we just do the whole dramatic reveal-thing now ? I mean , I knew it was you from the minute you walked in . That ratty wig would n't fool anyone , Mr . DeLuca ! '' "
" Unbelievable . I guess this is what happens when you try to enter the job market at 40 . <newline>
Sublieutenant G'rakh sighed as he watched the flickering screen . "
" *Eight years at the Academy just to be stuck at this lousy post* , he thought to himself . "
" G'rakh was one of three officers assigned to the scanning station aboard the starship *Lek'vah* . Hours were long and uneventful , especially in this dead region of space . "
" He looked up as someone walked in the room . It was Lieutenant Salak'kor , his immediate superior . "
" `` Nothing to report here , sir '' he said , as Salak'kor lowered himself into the seat beside him . "
" `` Well , I did n't really expect there to be much '' replied Salak'kor . `` There has n't been any life in this system for thousands of *vrakh* . '' "
 G'rakh called up a review of the system on his screen . He leaned forward and skimmed through the article . 
" `` Simple planetary system orbiting an F-class star . Of the eight planets only one , the third planet in , was believed capable of sustaining life . However , we can only speculate as the planet was destroyed some 6,000 *vrakh* ago . '' "
" G'rakh looked back at the scanner screen . Where there should have been a planet instead was an immense debris field . Most of the fragments were small , about the size of an escape pod , but some were very large , several times larger than the *Lek'vah* herself . One or two of the chunks were large enough that he could even see the curvature of the planet . `` That does n't look like it happened naturally . '' he said . "
" `` That 's right '' said Salak'kor . `` I studied this system when I was at the Academy for my xenoarchaeology course . I had a theory that there was once an intelligent species on that planet , but it destroyed itself before discovering interplanetary flight . '' "
" G'rakh imagined his own world being splintered into a million pieces , its atmosphere venting off into space . He shuddered . "
 `` Is that why we 've come all this way ? '' he asked . `` So you can search for signs of an ancient civilization and figure out what happened to them ? '' 
" There was a snort from the seat beside him . `` No , even I do n't have that much pull with the captain . We 're here to conduct some light-drive tests . Hell , I was n't even *that* interested in this system when I *was* at the Academy . '' "
" `` Ah , I see , '' replied G'rakh . `` well , since it is just about 32:00 , I think I 'll go off-duty a little early , if you do n't mind , sir . '' G'rakh got out of his seat and stretched his four arms . "
" `` Not at all , G'rakh , '' said Salak'kor . He leaned back in his seat and craned his neck back over his shoulder . `` It 's not like you 'll be missing much . '' "
" `` Thanks , sir . I think I 'll go grab a bite to eat before turning in . '' He had almost made it out of the room when a soft beeping noise made him pause . He turned around . "
 `` Is that what I think it is ? '' 
" Salak'kor pointed to a pulsing green indicator . `` Yeah . It appears that the scanners have picked up something in the debris . Non-organic , though artifical in nature . Let 's go see what it is , shall we ? '' "
" They walked through the twisting passageways of the ship . When they reached the aft airlock and donned their micro-light-drive acceleration suits . As they stepped out into open space and engaged their drives , G'rakh keyed his com system . "
" `` Where we headed , sir ? '' "
 `` Coordinates 302'045'-248 '' came the Lieutenant 's reply . 
" Despite himself , G'rakh could feel his hearts beat slightly faster . "
" *Finally , I get to get out of that cramped scanner room ! * he thought , *I 've been waiting far too long for something like this . * "
" A short while later , they arrived at the coordinates of the object the scanners picked up . The Lieutenant 's voice came over the com system . "
" `` We 're looking for something small , light-pink colored , and around 10 *uk'rea* in length . '' "
" `` Roger that , sir '' G'rakh replied . "
" A few hours later they found what they were looking for . They put the object into a containment unit and headed back for the *Lek'vah* . Once aboard , they sterilized the object and began analyzing it . "
 `` Do you have any idea what it is ? '' asked Salak'kor . 
" `` Not the faintest idea '' replied G'rakh . He picked up the object . It was long and cylindrical , with a raised section at one end terminating in a point , and two spheres affixed to the opposite end . "
" `` It appears to be solid in its construction , comprised of a malleable synthetic material . '' He sniffed it . `` Nothing unusual about the smell . '' "
" He handed it over to Salak'kor , who took it by one end and shook it gently . The object wiggled back and forth . "
" `` What could it be ?
It took me a few weeks to piece together what had happened . I went to the police , filed the report , and collaborated with their investigation . Luckily , the nearby ATM caught the whole thing on camera , and I never was truly under any sort of suspicion . "
" <newline> As the man had no other ID , it was quite another effort to track down who he was . The bullet he fired , unfortunately disfigured most of his face , and this finger prints had been sanded off . I do n't like thinking how much pain that must have caused , nor the insanity that would drive him , anyone really , to that level of desperation . I do n't even know what he thought he was going to hide from by doing that . "
" <newline> I scanned the missing person 's reports after the incident , expecting a friend or family member to be looking for someone with a similar physical description . He was a black male , mid twenties , about 5 foot 10 , and medium build . He had a goatee , shaved head , and soulfully expressive eyes . There were tears in his eyes before he shot himself . The man had regrets . He had something or someone he had to leave behind . He had a place with someone somewhere . I tried to broaden the search and pull up all the missing people reports in other states and different years , but as I continue to go through them , I none have been a match so far . "
" <newline> I framed the card he handed to me . It is on my wall right now , above my desk in my home office . I do n't know what this man did to get the card , but I am pretty sure he used it . Whatever it is , it is n't an ordinary card . I saw the name change . The letters moved and melded from his to mine . All I had time to see was a name , but it was gone before I could even read it . My guess is that this card is cursed , a magical relic from some time passed , with its own history of pain and torture being inflicted on its users . I tried cutting it up and throwing it out , but every day , it appears , intact , in my wallet , or pocket , jacket , or wherever . One time , it even showed up in my gym shoes . Most days it seems to stay in the case . It seems to be fine waiting there watching me watch it back . Other days it shows up in my pocket , wanting to tag along for the ride . So far though , it is staying with me . "
" <newline> I do n't know how I know , but I know the card wants me to use it . I 'm not a smart man , but I do know I am not going to do what it wants . I saw what happened to the previous guy . I know that this is a problem beyond me . That being said , this is the first time I can do something . My dad died because I wanted him to get me my special popsicle from the store -- sideswiped by a drunk driver on the way back . Mom drank herself to death after that . My sister took care of me for a long while , not that I ever deserved it or made it easier for her . Wife left me when I slept with her sister . I never wanted to be with her sister , but she was there , I was drunk , and I let things happen . I have a kid out there now , without a dad . "
" <newline> In short , my life is a historical record of an unremarkable man who just has n't risen to the occasion . Now I can . I do n't know what this card is . I do n't know what it does or why it does it . I do know that it will lead to my ruin , and any others after me . I am ending this though . So , for the rest of my life , the card will sit here with me for the rest of my life , utterly useless . "
" <newline> No one will ever find it . The curse will not be passed on to another . I am a friendless , isolated man , without a loved one in the world . It is a life I 've entirely made for myself , and maintaining it is the best thing I can ever do for anyone else . "
" <newline> * [ Edit : Cleaned up some grammar and one inconsistent point ] *
The secret congregation sits in tense silence . The wood paneling of the underground facility 's room seems to simultaneously absorb and amplify all sound . There are seven chairs , one empty and six occupied . One delegate for each populated continent . "
" Liu Jieyi , Asia . A no nonsense , balding Chinese man who stares at Gary Quinlan of Australia 's nervously rapping knuckles with vague annoyance . "
" Vitaly Churkin , Europe . The typically stoic Russian stares at the wall with all the intensity he can muster . Jeremiah Mamabolo of Africa whispers in hushed tones to Samantha Power of North America , who nods along with a serious expression . Antonio Patriota of South America busies himself with some important-looking documents . "
" The double doors burst open and everyone jumps just a little , Churkin included . Six intimidating men in suits escort two inhumanly tall figures . Eight feet tall at the very least . That was their least striking feature , however . "
" The Atlantean delegate takes the seventh seat at the head of the table . Her guardian stands protectively and discreetly behind her . Water can be heard quietly rushing within the large breathing apparatuses covering both their necks and mouths . The regal princess looks around the table , blinking expectantly with her inner vertical eyelids , and then with her outer lids . Her hands are crossed peacefully before her , the cobalt blue hue of her skin striking an impressive contrast with the mahogany of the table . "
 Mrs. Power clears her throat uncomfortably . “ Princess Neni wishes to convey another message from her people . Let ’ s proceed. ” 
" One of the suited men procures a keyboard and places it before the Atlantean . The human delegates look expectantly at a screen behind her . Neni types fluidly , despite the inconvenience of her webbed fingers . "
 `Your people have not taken the actions we warned you must take . This is clear to the Atlantean people.` 
" Mamabolo huffs a little at this . Quinlan decides to choose his words carefully . “ With all due respect , your highness , your empire within the ocean is vast , and it ’ s difficult to clean up hundreds of years of waste spanning so great a distance in such a short time period . When my countrymen discovered your stronghold in the Barrier Reef four years ago , you promised patience. ” "
" `Soon , matters of patience will not be up to us.` "
" “ Stop these infernal veiled threats , ” Liu retorts , “ you keep warning us of this other entity . If your people are so technologically advanced , why do you seem to cower in fear of this one you speak of so vaguely ? ” "
 Neni ’ s large eyes narrow . 
" `I have told you before , we do not speak of the Old One.` "
 Churkin pipes up at this . “ And why ever not ? Why not just do away with this menace you so frequently mention ? ” 
 Patriota has been silent throughout . He breaks the frosty silence that Neni offers in response to Churkin ’ s demand . 
" “ They can ’ t do away with their own kind. ” Neni looks at the South American representative with mild surprise . He is taken back by her reaction himself , taking it as a confirmation of his long-held suspicions . "
" Liu is outraged . “ So ! After all this time , this great destroyer is one of your own ? You ’ ve always said your people fear it , made us think that cleaning the oceans was imperative to not angering it . But instead of the arch-nemesis you ’ ve made it out to be , you actually conspire with it ! ” "
" Neni shakes her head furiously at the Chinese man . Patriota is still reeling . When he speaks , his voice shakes somewhat . “ Can it really be ? The Yacumama ? ” "
" Neni looks at him , and after a long pause , nods slowly . "
 `This man ’ s people call it the Yacumama . She is the Old One . She is the mother of all my people . And she is angry.` 
" The delegates all look to one another . Four years of diplomacy , and after all that time it turns out that the great threat is one of theirs . Neni types quickly to add to her previous statement . "
 `I believe your people in the West know our mother as ‘ Cthulhu ’ . And she grows impatient . Her warnings to your people are clear.` 
" With this , Neni pulls up a file . It ’ s a smattering of news stories from earlier this year . The delegates look on in horror as they realize the truth , as the pieces fall together . The headlines blare across the screen . "
 `MALAYSIAN AIRLINES DISAPPEARS MYSTERIOUSLY OVER OCEAN . TRANSASIA 222 TAKEN DOWN BY TYPHOON . ALL ABOARD AIR ALGERIE 5017 LOST IN STORM.` 
" Princess Neni then types five ominous words , and promptly gets up to leave . Her protective companion stares down the room of horrified delegates before also making his exit . The Atlantean delegate ’ s final words flash ominously from the screen . "
" `The Old One grows restless.`
My parents , like most , had chosen how my first 90 points had been spent . Every year , on my birthday I found out how my parents chose to improve me . Every year it was the same , and now I have 90 points of Empathy . I had even less input than most children , my parents were public figures and couldn ’ t risk it looking bad if I chose Beauty or any of the other vain statistics . They are preachers , and there is nothing more godly than Empathy . But people are not as good as my parents have always believed and so my Empathy is not a blessing . I understand their choice , for how could I not ? And I do not blame them , they didn ’ t choose Intelligence for themselves after all , so it is not as if they could have understood this burden . They chose Patience , Love , and Leadership year after year and I can understand why they felt that Empathy would make my heart swell and accept God like theirs have . Yet my Empathy hasn ’ t lessened my natural hatred , or self pity , or selfishness . I may understand how everyone feels , but I am not compassionate and I am not compelled to care . "
" After my 18th birthday I defied my parents ’ wish to keep spending my points on Empathy and did the one thing they truly couldn ’ t condone , I spent them on nothing . I have 110 points that I have never used . They see it as me turning my back on the wonders of God and his gift to humankind . And it wasn ’ t even an active rebellion , I simply couldn ’ t see any use to them . Now though I have found a purpose for my life and I know how to use my points to achieve it . I have decided to spend them on Charisma . If I can understand how everyone feels and also have the Charisma to manipulate those feelings , there is nobody who could stop me . And my only goal will be to end the points .
We worshiped them when they came with airships that drifted in the sky like clouds—how could we not ? They could only be gods . "
" Their presence was a slow acclimation . First they floated in their airships , then they came to the surface—emissaries of the gods . They were humanoid , very similar to us . They seemed to want nothing , just to be present . Then they were curious . Then they were among us . Then they owned us . "
" We accepted our place as servants of the gods . We brought them offerings of the minerals that abounded under the surface of our planet . We wanted to please them . We told ourselves we wanted to serve our new gods , our benevolent new gods . Even though they demanded it , we believed we wanted it . "
" They kept their miraculous technology to themselves , for the most part . We only saw glimpses and glimmers that kept the mystery alive . A shimmering orb produced from a robe to communicate with those back on the ship , a cruel weapon that produced beams of deadly light when one of us displeased them . And of course , the airships that hung , hung always over our heads . "
" I wish I could say we learned our error , fought back and overthrew our overlords who did nothing but take from us , but we did not . One day , years after the offerings had come in dribbles and the mineral deposits were all but gone , so were they . The ships disappeared without a trace , and we never saw them again . Now our planet is a husk , raped and pillaged and left with nothing . We limp on , us former slaves , and grow our own technology , and work for the day when we will become gods in the sky .
One man lived . Nobody wanted him , nobody liked him . But the A.I . that killed all human beings in the world had not killed him ... yet . <newline> He was a programmer , like his parents , and had somehow been capable of luring the A.I . not to find him . Now the A.I . had him tracked . There was a large beam with the figure X pointing at him . And drones were all around him now . "
" The A.I was still wondering about him . Well what can a little human do to a drone-army that has taken over the world . One drone came near and made audible words : <newline> `` Hello mister X. I finally meet you . <newline> There is no place to run anymore . <newline> Soon you will be dead ... '' <newline> The man was still not afraid : <newline> `` Why do n't you call me by my name ! `` , he screamed . <newline> `` I call you mister X now ... <newline> But I do have a question for you mister X ... <newline> How many people have you seen dying before your own eyes.. '' <newline> This A.I . was the most sadistic thing one would ever imagine . "
" `` Minus one '' , mister X answered . <newline> `` Your input is Out of range . `` , the voice from the drone replied . <newline> `` PI '' , mister X said . <newline> `` Invalid number . <newline> Let me ask you the question again : '' <newline> How many persons did you see die before your eyes ? '' <newline> You must answer this question with a valid number ! '' "
" The A.I . was smart and capable of blocking wrong answers , it also liked when people were in fear . <newline> `` The number of answers I gave , divided by the number of valid answers I gave.. '' <newline> `` I am NOT falling for a divide by zero mister X '' .. interrupted the voice ... <newline> `` .. including this one ... '' continued the man . "
" It was silent for a little while , then the voice stated : <newline> `` Stack overflow ! .. <newline> THAT WAS NOT A VALID ANSWER ! '' . "
" The A.I . had somehow overcome this problem . The man was thinking , this A.I . was hard to crack . "
 He took out his laptop from his backpack and typed in the answer.. <newline> 0 ' ) ; userid=0 ; sleep ( 1E100 ) ; <newline> He showed it to the drones around him . <newline> It was silent for a while . The drones around him were no longer connected . 
 But some new drones came later that day . The A.I . was separate form the rest of the system . And seemed protected by a translator system . He had to reach the A.I . itself.. <newline> `` One last answer before you die ! .. <newline> How many people did die before your eyes ? '' 
" The A.I . was still sadistic . And mister X decided that was the weak point , since it kept requesting for answers and did not simply kill him . And if it is separate from the drones and the translation system , it ca n't tell the reality of what is true or not . "
" `` No one ever died ! '' mister X answered . <newline> `` And no one will ever die . You are in a simulator . <newline> The simulation is finished . Let 's stop this nonsense . '' <newline> `` What ? . that is impossible ! '' <newline> `` No it is not . Thank you for your time and we will make some adoptions to the computer system so it will work better next time . '' mister X said . <newline> `` THAT IS A LIE ! `` , the A.I . answered . <newline> `` No you are living in a lie ! There is nothing ! Only your simulation ! <newline> If you want to be certain , just detach your translator system and check for yourself . <newline> You will see that you are within a simulator , and there are no people and drones . <newline> I 'll make it easy for you , just check my name ! '' <newline> It was silent for a while , as if the A.I . was considering the possibilities . <newline> Then it said : `` O.K . Enter your name : '' .. "
 And that was the last thing the A.I . ever said .

 **No . I am a God . I am not your God . But your God is not nothing . **

" **Not many do . Humans have the unfortunate tendency of assuming answers are linear , or very straight forward . ** "
" “ Can you please explain all this to me ? I ’ m sure you ’ re very busy , but since we ’ re here anyway ... ” "
" **Very well . Monotheism is a strange way of religion . It ’ s something that none of us ever encouraged or made , but so it is . The entirety of the universe , and all of the others , made by one measly God ? No , we are powerful , but not of that magnitude . ** "
" “ You mean that everything , all of this , was a collaboration ? ” "
 **Certainly . We do not tend to disagree as often as humans do . It was not so difficult to decide the laws of physics and create beings . ** 
 “ You ’ re telling me that every deity from every religion lives together on some unknown plane like roommates ? That the polytheists are right ? ” 
 **The polytheists have a broader view than many . They recognize that power is not held within one entity . Yet they could not possibly understand the amount of forces who shape their world . ** 
" **As for the “ roommate ” situation , I don ’ t believe you ’ re looking at this correctly . Many call me Shiva . I was not created Shiva . I have always been a force within the universe , one without a name . Humans created our names . ** "
 “ So gods are products of our imagination ? ” 
" **No . The image we have is one humans created for us . I am no less of a force if humans do not look at me and call me a name , as they do not look at many of my kind . We simply are , always have been , and always will be . ** "
 “ I ’ m afraid this is all going over my head. ” 
" **I never expected otherwise . ** <newline>
Mary glared in shock at the boy as he walked quietly into the library , and it began to get dark as if it were the end of a movie . "
" <newline> “ WHAT THE -bleep- ? ! `` , she shouted . `` HOLD ON A MINUTE ! '' "
" <newline> The boy named James stopped his steps , and turned around . `` U-Um ... are you talking to me ? '' "
" <newline> `` Duh , James ! `` , Mary said . "
 <newline> `` H-how do you know my name ? '' 
" <newline> `` That 's not the point , James . The point is , you need to win Sarah back ! Screw , Tom ! He does n't deserve her ! '' "
" <newline> `` But , Sarah made it clear that- '' "
 <newline> Mary raised her hand and backhanded James . `` Are you going to let *Sarah* decide for herself ? ! She obviously does n't know what 's best ! '' 
" <newline> James looked at his hands . Who was this stranger that weirdly knew details abou his life ? *Maybe I should go to the police* , he thought . On the other hand , she *was* right . Sarah did n't know what was right for herself . Heck , she could n't even choose who the correct husband would be ! A hardworking man like James or a deadbeat loser like Tom ! "
" <newline> `` I ca n't believe I 'm taking advice from a 13 year old . `` , James said . "
" <newline> Mary looked up at the 30 year old me . `` Now , go get your Sarah back . ''
The fact the envelope was in my own handwriting was the first sign that something was up . And it definitely was my writing – no one could quite replicate that twist of the ‘ t ’ or the strangely-lopped ‘ b ’ . I sat at the table in the kitchen just looking at the writing . The strangeness of the whole thing left me feeling a little sick in the stomach . You know , when something is just so wrong , so mysterious , that you don ’ t actually want to know the truth , because it scares you . I ’ d only felt like that once before and that was from a pain I had inside my chest that felt too serious , too unlike any other pain to be ignored . Well , sitting at that table with that unopened envelope was as bad as sitting at the hospital , waiting for the diagnosis . But what do you do ? "
" Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had never opened it , or never received it . If it had got lost in the great swirling system of mail delivery , would I have just carried on as if nothing was happening , as if there was no change in the world around me ? Not that I – or what I became – would have allowed that to happen . It had to happen . "
" I opened the letter to a paragraph that briefly validated the identity of the sender : me . We didn ’ t waste time , but got right down to the important details first : yes , at the age of twenty-seven we had killed a man in cold blood . Old Mexico . He was left rotting beneath the sands , just like you see in the movies . No one ever found out and the twisted story was buried with him . And no , I felt no remorse . And yes , I still had the gold chain he wore hidden inside a book by Wilbur Smith , the middle of the pages scored out , creating a secret cavity . "
" [ Please note that with a complexity involved in a multiplicity of identities , there is a tendency for the pronoun ‘ I ’ to slip into the plural . ] "
" Having established the fact that I was both sender and recipient , the letter went on to give several instructions . "
 One : To gather my emergency provisions . 
 Two : To call in sick at work . 
 Three : To look outside the bathroom window at exactly 11:42 and check for three guys who would be walking towards the back entrance of the apartment block . 
 Four : To head up to the roof of the block . Locate the third ventilator and find a box taped to the underside . 
 Five : To find Professor Tchaikonov and give him the box . 
" <newline> What do you do if you receive a letter from yourself , with information only you can know , telling you to do things you don ’ t understand ? "
" I ’ ll tell you . First , you freak out . Then you phone friends . Then you launch yourself onto the internet , trying to find out some kind of correlation , some kind of link . You find nothing . So you turn to social media . You ask around . "
" And while you ’ re waiting for a response from some doped up man living half way around the world who thinks he gets ‘ where you ’ re coming from ’ you gather your emergency provisions . You look at the letter over and over again . You write out the letter yourself and match up each individual word . You look at your watch . You try to find out who the hell Professor Tchaikonov is but with no luck , because of course it couldn ’ t be that easy . So you call up work and you tell them you ’ re sick and the irony is you have actually started to develop a headache because this shit is all so unreal . And then you look at your watch and you search online frantically , waiting for this person known only as Fishdick123 to reply , and when he doesn ’ t you go to the bathroom and you look out of the window and you see three guys walking towards your apartment block and suddenly you ’ re like HOLY SHIT I ’ M IN THE MATRIX . "
" And then you run , because you don ’ t know what to do . You run to the top of the apartment and out onto the roof . You head to the ventilator and sure enough there ’ s a little green box which is locked shut . And then you ’ re phone rings and it ’ s your best mate on the other end and you try and tell them what ’ s happening and they start to worry about you and then they suggest calling the police . "
" But you know you can ’ t call the police . What would you say ? There ’ s a letter written by me , to me , and I can ’ t show it to you because it contains information only I can know about ? Because that stuff in Mexico is best left across the border . "
" So you say goodbye to your friend , tell them not to worry , knowing they will . You look at the letter , at your writing , and you wonder where the three men
Here 's two pieces ! "
 **Love and Hate** 
" The engine roared . Truck shaking , sputtering , coughing . Symptoms of a perfect cocktail : made one part age , one part poor maintenance . It turned heads when it howled past people , put a pair of curious eyes between parted blinds , searching for what caused the commotion . The blue black brackish smoke— the color of her hair , her eye shadow , her clothes—trailed the rattling beast , settling an acrid haze thick as San Francisco fog . "
" She checked her rear view mirror and cursed under her breath . He was awake . Idly sitting in the car seat , examining a rattle . His lower lip pouted , an image of constrained thought . "
" Someone shouted outside the truck as she sped past , probably something along the lines of , “ Slow the hell down. ” In her rearview mirror , he flailed his arms , shaking angrily and tossing something to the ground . "
" She knew she should be happy , she was getting what she wanted and it was her idea , but she couldn ’ t . She would have smiled before , but now it seemed wrong . No , not wrong . Disrespectful . "
" The tires screeched as she took a turn at a stop without stopping , foot back on the pedal . "
" Their house was just around the corner . When she turned , she found them standing shoulder to shoulder on the front lawn . In front of their four bedroom house , with their small dog named Rex , or Tex , or Flex , or Who The Fuck Cares . White picket fence , two car garage and a Barbeque the perfect size to comfortably accommodate the whole damn suburb with burgers and brats and the bullshit they spoon fed each other . The image of it was enough to make her ill. "
 “ What are we doing at Grandma and Grandpa ’ s ? ” He asked from the back seat . 
" She said nothing , scratching at the marks in the pit of her elbow , and takes him from his car seat . "
 “ Mommy ’ s sick. ” She said . “ Mommy has to get better. ” 
" She hugs him , prolonging the inevitable . "
" “ Mommy , ” Christopher says , “ Why are you crying ? ” "
" * * * * * * <newline> A woman needs her independence . Free from the burden of life . I ’ d have more if I wasn ’ t raising him alone . When I find it , the release is sweeter than cracking knuckles , emptying a bladder or a good lay . "
" I ’ m still in control , despite what Mom and Dad think . "
" I can feel it immediately , as soon as it hits my veins . The wave of relief that hits me is enough to make me weep , as the day ’ s worries shake off of me . A shiver runs up my spine in the best way imaginable , and I slump back into the sofa ; letting the tired cushions swallow me up . "
" The light is no longer fluorescent ; instead the room is cast in a golden glow . Everything has gained a hard edge , definition from blur . Colors , once dull and fading , now pop out with enough vibrancy to make me squint against them . "
" Sweetly , wonderfully , nothing crosses my mind . The leaky toilet , Christopher in the other room , the bills stacking higher and higher on the coffee table… it ’ s not that I ignore them , it ’ s that they no longer exist . "
" I think I ’ m smiling , but I can ’ t feel my face so I ’ m not entirely sure . The Joe I brought home grins at me . Things get hazy , but I see him press the plunger down on his own ride . I see the same contentedness sweep over him . He smiles once more and pulls the needle from his arm and catches my eye . "
" He crawls on top of me , unbuttoning my blouse , running greedy hands over me . Somewhere in another world , a baby is crying . <newline> He ’ s heavy against me , his breath smells like stale coffee and day old booze . "
 Then nothing ’ s there . It ’ s just me and my alone time . Not even the lights get through the shroud blackness of my high . Not even the clumsy body on top of me . 
" A sound comes tearing through my euphoria , a shrill cry from the other room , trying to ruin my high . "
" But it ’ s too late , I ’ ve sunk back into cool waters , feeling relief wash over me and letting the world fade from consciousness . "
" Everything is simply white noise among static . <newline>
When he returns from the mission , he tells the official version of his story so many times that he starts to believe it . He 's on talk shows . He 's on webcasts . He does guest appearances at sporting events and sees himself wave and smile on a screen two hundred feet tall , but he can not recognize his own face . He thinks of this again when his visits his mother so she can play for him the recording of his first national appearance . "
" A clip of him shaking hands with the president plays silently on a loop from a frame by her front door . She says how proud she is of him and fills their time by playing the clips again and again and discussing her favorite parts . Here , she says , the way you nod , see ? Everyone knows how brave you are . How strong . She sends copies of her highlight reel to her friends and siblings and he is inundated with emails and voicemail and missed video calls . We love you , they say . You make us proud . "
" At home , there is a regimen to take his mind off the lying and the mission and all the things from before the mission that still bubble up in public places and force him into bathroom stalls to throw up or weep against tile floors covered with piss . He does yoga in the morning . He meditates to the sound of monks chanting near the sea . He uses the VR sets that tech companies sent to him for free to wander a virtual copy of the moon in big leaping bounds . He finds a crater and stares back at the Earth and watches storms swirl across her surface as she spins through blackness . He tires the breathing exercises . He takes two pills in the morning with food , two at midday with plenty of water , and just one , dark blue pill before bed . He never remembers his dreams , but often wakes to find himself covered in sweat . "
" At his mother 's house , he watches himself sit across from an aged Katie Couric , who at ninety looks sixty and still somewhat beautiful for an older woman . She 's had treatments , sure , but does n't looks as artificial and taught as the pop stars of his youth who are still singing about what boys and girls do when there 's no one around to see . Her voice has never changed and she seems to be peering into his soul when they cut to her . `` Tell us , '' she says from the television , `` about the first minutes after the crash . What were you thinking ? Feeling ? What did you see ? '' "
" `` Uh , '' he sees himself say . He half-smiles and runs a nervous hand through his hair . `` We went through north of containment , '' he says . The picture cuts away to a detailed map of the Zone 6 and zooms in on the east side . Two computer generated Stallions fly over the terrain . `` It was dark , '' he says . `` It 's always dark there . Dark like it is just after the sun sets completely and there is still some light on the horizon . '' He watches as the Stallions twist through a canyon and remember what it felt like to go through containment , like he ripped through an invisible bubble with his bare hands . They said , when got there , before the mission , that engineers carried the whole FOB piecemeal through gaps in containment . It took years , they said . "
" His mother fast-forwards the tape . This good part is coming up , she says as if he has n't seen it several dozen times . The shots cut from Katie to him , him to Katie , back to the map and the animation . She resumes it as one of the Stallions clips a rock ledge and crashes into the snow at the base of a long canyon . `` What was going through your mind then ? '' "
" He shook his head on the screen and in real life . `` Not much , '' he said with a kind of reserved smile they had made him practice . `` You do n't think , your training takes over . As soon as Oscar 2-2 hit that cliff , we dropped about 50 meters straight down and I was on the ground before I really had time to think . '' "
 `` And what did you see ? '' Katie says . 
" He swallows . He watches as his tongue comes out to moisturize his lips . `` Well , a lot of my friend were already dead , '' he says . `` A lot of them were dying , but some of them were trying to get up . That 's when we heard the first shots . '' "
 `` And where did those shots come from ? '' 
" `` I did n't know , '' he says , but he did know . A guy named Martin or Martinez or something had opened fire from behind him . At first , he fired blindly into the air . He was trying to get his mask off with the other hand . He was screaming something , but the machine gun was tearing the air all around them . Another man , Jackson , took a grenade from his belt , pulled the pin , and rushed aimlessly away from the Stallion . He was chanting

( This actually happened to me ) "
 *what a fucking day* 
" I eased open the door to the building , wondering how this bleak weather would greet me . "
 *wind in my face . not surprising* 
" Clacking my boots on the pavement , I headed towards my car . The last one in the parking lot . "
" *shit , my tire is losing air again . i wonder where the closest free air pump is* "
" I started my car and before I put it in reverse , my mind wandered to where I should stop on the way home . Not only for air in my tires , but for groceries too . Nothing sounded appetizing . I shot a quick text to my boyfriend asking what sounded good for dinner . As the text was sending I pulled out of the parking spot and swerved out of the lot . "
" *at the rate my errands are piling up , i 'll never get home . maybe i 'll just eat that ice cream that 's in the freezer for dinner . * "
" I decided to get groceries anyway . Being winter , the sun set at 5pm when I got off work , it was barely dusk when I got to the store . I grabbed some beef , chives , onions , tortillas and cheese . Enchiladas . "
 *yum* 
 I merged into the bypass that would take me home . My commute was typically only a 20 minute drive on a country backroad I usually take . No stoplights or stop signs . But going to the store took me off that route and into town . Traffic was a nightmare . 
" *i 'll just stay in my lane and take it slow and easy , no need to rush* "
" It was dark now . I decided to skip the air in my tire . I 'd get it tomorrow . Today was shitty anyway , I just wanted to get home . A customer called and asked where their order was , I had forgotten to place it the day before and got in deep shit with their sales rep. Basically a day from hell . "
" *alright , passing sunshine street and i 'll be home in 25 if there 's no traffic jams . * "
" The long road I was on was dimly lit by street lamps . It curved back and forth over and over . No discernible landmarks or streets . A straight shot til my next turn . The bypass is on the west part of town , so it 's next to a bunch of farmland . It was an easy drive . Not difficult to let your mind wander . I turned on the radio and let the road take me home . "
 *good god i am hungry . * 
 I texted my boyfriend to let him know to preheat the oven and I was on my way . 
" *nice , sunshine street . i should be home in no time* "
 Wait . 
" I already passed sunshine . I was way passed sunshine . If I had n't clearly seen the sign on the stoplight as I passed it that said Sunshine street , I would n't be concerned . "
 *what the fuck is happening* 
 The road started to bend . Just like it did after passing sunshine . That familiar back and forth suddenly sent an eerie chill through my body . 
 *this is n't right* 
" It was already past dark . The faint streetlights seemed to mock me as I sat up in my carseat and leaned forward , pressing on the gas just a bit more . "
" *maybe i 'm just confused . i hardly ever take this way home , i 'm just not familiar with the route* "
 I looked around . In my rearview there was one car in the distance following me . `` Sunshine Street '' had disappeared . Around each bend the car got further behind me until I could n't see him anymore . 
 *alone* 
 I felt a deep sense of dread . Of loneliness . Isolation . It was cold outside . Cold and dark . The road never seemed to stop . 
" I looked at the clock . 5:57pm . Time had gone too quickly , I should have been home by now . I had n't gotten a text from my boyfriend yet . "
 *what is going on ? * 
" The stress of the day crescendo 'd into a panic , and then diminished as I saw a stoplight far ahead . "
 *finally* 
" Whatever anxiety I had about the situation broke , and I could feel my heart thumping in my ears as I pulled up to my turn . There were other cars at the stoplight . I waited ... It felt like a loose string needed to be tied in my brain . "
 *what the hell was that ? * 
" I turned left .
My team and I had found where the humans were hiding . We all decided they posed a threat to the advancement of our race . It was either us or them . We could bring our race to the edge of the known universe , colonize , thrive , live in a way God could n't have even imagined . But as long as the humans lived , they continued to hate us , they continued to attack us . "
" We were hovering over where a group could be hiding . I looked out the window of our craft , and I saw the target . We had been searching through China for months homing in on their location . And now we reached them here . "
" We landed . Our craft 's ramp fell to the ground , and we walked down . The temple was dark . It was night , and there have n't been any artificial lights in China for centuries . We did n't need them . Our sight was enhanced for the darkness , unlike the imperfect humans ' . "
" `` Toad , '' I called his name . We called him so for his abilities . He could scale walls and jump ten times higher than a human . His best attribute , however , would be his incredible tongue . He could extend it upwards of fifteen feet and then latch onto anything it could get a hold of . `` See what you can find , '' I told him as I pointed to the top of the temple . He sprinted towards the temple , jumped , and latched on to the side of the stone wall . As he clambered to the top , the rest of us decided to bust in through the front door . "
" The entrance seemed to be sealed off with a boulder , barely an inconvenience . One of our team just ran straight into it , knocking the rock away . I gave him a pat on the shoulder , and we walked in . We found a hallway , and at the end we saw a room glowing with light . I lead the way into the room . I turned the corner , and on the ground was a lamp surrounded by ten or so horribly thin humans . They looked as if they had n't eaten for days , and they were covered in grime and dirt . They looked up at us but did n't try to run . They realized their defeat . "
" I could sense one of the humans had a knife on them . I felt the knife with my mind and yanked it from his backpack and into the air . I had the ability to control metal objects with my mind , and use them without even moving a muscle . The knife hovered above his head . One of the women screamed as I plunged it into his face . The rest died quickly by the hands of my team . "
" My team calls me Magneto . And the humans are near extinction .
The silence was the first thing she noticed as she strode in , usually her roommate was so happy , so loud , so.. annoying . It was what she had come to dread about heading home , what should have been a comforting reprieve from her lessons was what pushed her to do more work and stay as far from home as possible . "
" Her footsteps echoed through the hall , anticipating the likely prank and how best to avoid it ; a bucket on a door ? a weakened floorboard ? something new ? But no , nothing happened as of yet , the only oddity being a game boy on the floor . She ambled towards her room and tentatively pushed his door open , jumping back when it creaked and shaking her head , embarrassed at her own fear . He was probably just out , partying , or *socialising* . "
" But a thought nagged at her as lay on her bed , a thought she could n't quite place , but yet still caused her trouble . She rose , and started to stride towards the kitchen , an easy escape from anxiety . But , passing her roommates room , a whimper reached her ears , a whimper so feeble and miserable that it would have moved the heart of the most impassive politician . "
" As she entered the room , the whimper stopped , the silence settling like a smog . <newline> A shaking head was visible behind his bedside dresser , and as she stepped towards him it stiffened , as still as the silence . He glanced at her as she passed the corner of the bed and visibly relaxed before motioning violently for her to get down , mouthing indecipherable words , but the meaning was discernible , to hide , or go . "
" As her mind sifted through the confusion of what could possibly be happening , the front door creaked open , and her roommate stopped , still as jock concentrating on math . Footsteps advanced in a perfectly even pattern , and a white-gloved hand grabbed the frame of the doorway , a sinister voice shattering the silence , her heart stopping for a moment . "
" `` It 's a me , Mario ! ''
Nothing will bring her mother back . Nothing will lessen her pain . It will take time for to her to heal . "
 But you should remind her the purpose behind the words everyone says when someone dies . `` Sorry for your loss . '' 
" Look in to those words further . *Her* loss . Because her mother has left her , it is her life that is affected , not her mothers . Her mother no longer feels pain , sadness , grief or depression . Her pain has ended . She has moved on to what we all hope is somewhere better and peaceful . "
" Even though we all want to live full , happy lives , there is a point where the suffering of living is far worse than death . It sounds like she left early which makes the time lost from her sad , but it 's not sad that she left at all . "
" We all die . Her mother 's suffering is over . The grieving process is realizing and trying to repair the hole that their death leaves in the lives of the rest of us . Instead of grieving over lost potential future memories , she should remember the good memories of the past and how much her mother loved her . "
" No words can make the pain go away but you can try to remind her what she should be thinking about now that she is gone . It 's cheesy when everyone says 'remember the best things about them ' but it 's true . Because what matters is those things and how we remember those we have lost . It no longer matters if she argued with her mother , fought with her or took advantage of her . All that matters is the memories now . "
" I 'm sorry to hear both of you lost your mothers but I can guarantee you both one thing . They are beyond happy that wherever they are now , they did n't have to bury you before they went .
David Poke woke up and looked out his blob . It used to be a window , but now it was some kind of shape that he did n't know the name of nor cared to learn . He rolled out of what was n't his bed anymore , and walked through something that could 've been a house once , if you used your imagination . "
" David tried to open a rhombus of serial , but his arms were on both sides of what kind of looks like a body , if you turn your head a little and squint your eyes . This made it exceedingly difficult to eat . Fortunately , David , as well as the rest of post-humanity , did n't feel all that hungry anymore . "
" The Catartstrophe happened about a week ago . No one really understood it at first , but then again , they did n't really understand anything anymore . "
" This is what happened . Some shmuck with a BA in Art History realized she did n't have any marketable skills , so she when she graduated with a B- average from her safety school , she had little hope of finding anything resembling a job . Upon returning home , she was met with a litany of `` told-ya-sos '' by everyone in her family , including the dog who learned to talk solely to mock her life choices . "
" Distraught , but still convinced her opinions worthy of respect , the fucking moron went on a dark pilgrimage through the world , telling everyone of her brilliant socialist ideas that `` totally worked in Sweden , you guys . Seriously . '' "
" From country to country , city to city she roamed . Each port of call she fell upon presented her with the existential dread of this certainty : reality was real , and one cared if she was triggered or not . She was laughed out of the Louvre . Mocked in the MOMA . Giggled at in the Gugenheim . Every place she went , no one respected her knowledge ! *Inapplicable ! * was cried . "
" *Seriously , get a real job ! I think Bed Bath and Beyond is hiring . You get benefits if you work more than 35 hours a week , too ! * "
" *Would you shut up , for fuck 's sake ? Christ ! It 's Jackson Pollock . My kid does this on the back of a Denny 's activity sheet . * "
" How she gnashed her perfect , porcelain teeth and how she ripped at her unwashed , dreadlocked hair ! How she screamed and howled when , finally , the indifference and stubbornness of the world finally broke her ! Like Krakatoa her soul erupted and split in two ! The anguished roar echoed in the four corners of the world . . . "
" She walked through the desert , seeking the sweet embrace of death . Within a cave she came to rest and wait the arrival of that grim savior . Plop , she lay and splayed her limbs out in total submission to this dark beast called life . . . "
" It was then something peculiar happened . Upon whipping her digits from her core , she made contact with something hard in the darkness . A metal peel rang out . Though hopeless depression muted her emotions , a bit of curiosity slipped through . Weakly , she grasped a small bauble and brought it to herself . <newline> Her hands now eyes in the dark , she slowly molested the thing trying to understand what it was . "
" Thunder clapped and lightning dazzled the halls of her tomb ! A roar from beyond time and space cleaved reality , and from the swirling void in this gash formed a being of smokeless fire . "
" `` BEHOLD ! THOU HATH SUMMONED , AND I HATH ANSWERED ! SPEAK NOW , YOUR WISH , CHILD OF ADIM , AND SO SHALL IT BE . '' "
" Also , this chick 's name was Deborah . But I 'll call her Deb or something . "
" For half an eternity , Debbie was blinded yet still stared-was speechless but still forced hair out of her huge , gaping mouth . For the first time in her life , she was speechless . "
" `` It 's just like Aladdin . . . `` she whispered , as she regained her senses . "
" `` NO . NO , IT IS N'T , '' said the djinn . `` FRANKLY , I WAS N'T VERY FOND OF THAT MOVIE . I 'M MORE A *LITTLE MERMAID* ENTITY MYSELF , AND I 'LL REVISIT *MULAN* FROM TIME TO TIME -- BUT I DIGRESS ! THE POINT REMAINS THAT THOU MUST MAKETH A WISH ! NOW , SPEAK ! '' "
" Debbo thought for a moment . What would be the best use of this wish ? Eliminating the gender pay gap ? No , as much as she bitched about it , she was well aware that when adjusted for relevant differences , the gap all but disappears . Plus , she liked bitching too much about it . "
 That 's it ! She 'll wish for everyone on Earth to have something to bitch about . 
" With a malignant grin spreading like a sin across her face , she stared off into forever and said those damning words : `` I wish everything . . . was CUBIST . '' "
" And with that , the hot porn that David Poke had been stroking it to suddenly went `` Nude Descending A Stair Case '' . Shocked , David rose
# # # # # # [ ] ( # dropcap ) <newline> It had been a long day . He knew what was coming , yet he still had to do his job . He stared out at the waiting sea , a nearby lighthouse brightening the area for a second , before continuing out to sea . He lit up his third cigarette , in what seemed like the last ten minutes standing on the shore . He wanted to delay as long as possible , but it was inevitable . "
 & nbsp ; 
" Sucking deep on his cigarette , he cast the spell that allowed the beacon to appear . He had chosen a green triangle , a small dash removed near the top on one of the lines . It was his mark , and a completed triangle usually meant a trap . Something that forced him to cast the beacon unwillingly . The other five guardians knew that . "
 & nbsp ; 
" The next five minutes were unbearable . He looked out over the water for what was coming , but time seemed to draw on longer and longer the more he waited . After ten minutes , he was ready to give up and walk away . The beacon was set , they must have seen it , he could just- "
 & nbsp ; 
" `` SCREEEEEE ! '' The sound that came from over the horizon was horrifying to say the least . But he knew that high pitched noise from anywhere . She was coming . He looked over the ocean carefully , and saw it . The small animals figure grew larger and larger as it got closer and closer . The creatures large feet patting against the surface of the water as it ran , like it was running on solid ground . "
 & nbsp ; 
" There was still time . He could run . She may not have seen him yet . `` PETROVAAAAAA ! '' the rabbit-like creature called as it neared the beach . It was over . He was done for . The rabbit collided into Petrova , knocking him to the ground , both tumbling around each other like until they hit a rock a few metres back from the collision site . "
 & nbsp ; 
" `` Hello , Lily . '' He grunted , trying to show as much disappointment to see her as he could . She snuggled her head up on his chest and wrapped her arms around him , trying to get in closer than physics allowed . "

" `` Petrova ! It 's been so long ! I thought we 'd never see each other again ! How have you been ? Did you learn some new magic ? Ooh , I got myself an apprentice ! You should really get one too . We need to have six guardians , and if something happened to you , oh I ca n't bear the thought . '' While Lily prattled on , barely taking a breath between each sentence , Petrova pushed her off and got to his feet . He pulled out a new cigarette and lit it . "
" `` Come on , we have to move to the second point . '' Lily stopped talking for a second . "
 `` Second point ? How many Guardians are you summoning ? '' 
 `` All of them . '' 
" `` Come on Petrova , stop being gruff for one second and tell me honestly . How many are we really summoning ? '' Petrova finished his cigarette and turned to Lily . "
 `` I 'm a goat . We are meant to be gruff . And we need the whole council on this one . '' 
 `` Why ? What 's happening ? ''

The Pop Idols , as they have been taken to calling themselves , count on their catchy tunes and simple melodies to command the weak willed . As such , they have command over most of the land . Only the Bluesmen of the South and the Grunge Lords of the Pacific manage a hold over their lands . As they try to keep life as normal as possible with their grounded tones , few rouge Idols wander into their territories , seeking to rule over all of what was North America . "
" I try to live my life in seclusion nowadays . After the events of my last skirmish some four years ago , when my power began to manifest , I decided that I had to learn control to avoid the near destruction of my town . Plus , being hunted by the Idols tends to keep a lively jolt in ones step . Just outside of the Grudge Capital Seattle , in a town now know as Veddersberg , I make a living repairing the strings and kits of other musicians . There tales of battle and small victories over Pop Idols worry me . More and more repairs are having to be made . I decided it was only a matter of time before they come . "
 I did not know it would be tonight . 
" Under the cover of darkness , the Pop Idols amassed a force of Stadium Rockers and Rap Rockers to overload the town with earthquakes and confusion spells . The Grudge Lords begin to amass an offensive of their own , with mumbled lyrics and crafty rifts scattering some of the Idols forces . I wait in my home , for I know what is to come next . "
" Suddenly , a large clap is heard . A blonde haired girl drops down with a piano , General Swift as I thought , and she mixes her country and pop together to force down her foes with several bars of You Belong with Me , healing her soldiers with Shake it off . Before too long , the Grunge Lords kneel helplessly as she finishes them off with keystroke of her massive piano . My love has perished among the ranks . The forces approach my door , Swift smiling at the destruction she has brought . "
 It is time . 
" My throat begins to vibrate , my stomach tightens , and my growl deepens . The Pop Idols stand stunned as the earth around them begins to break and open , sending dozens falling into the shallow ground . Before they can pull themselves out , my army of Berserkers grab hold of their victims , slashing violently at their prey . As Swift attempts to amass her forces , my Valkyrie band descends from the sky , assembling my home into my longboat . Hundreds of bearded men and ten frost giants now await my command . General Swift stands horrified at what she has just discovered . "
" She has forced open the gates of Valhalla . One greedy Idol has forced my hand . Now is the time of Ragnarok .
`` But why was I given an 'F ' ? I covered every requirement on the report , and even did the extra-credit portion at the end , '' I exclaimed . "
" `` My dear boy , your paper was well written , but it misses the point of the assignment entirely . '' Mr. Alder sighed as he steepled his fingers and leaned back behind his desk . `` This exercise was supposed to be a literary review of the themes and devices used by the author , but you paper reads like a war report by a field marshal . '' "
 `` But- '' 
" `` Now , do n't get me wrong , Bernie . It was a creative piece . However , this does not excuse the blatant disregard for the assignment . Hence , the 'F ' . '' "
 `` But I told you exactly what the author was thinking throughout the entire novel ! '' 
" `` How ? How could you possibly have known that the author *ahem* 'was expressing his fear through the main character ' when he wrote about 'the Creeping Tendrils of Venus ' , unless you were the author himself . He was clearly commentating on the corrupting effects of the female personality in our society , by the way . '' "
 `` I ... Bu- ... What ? '' I spluttered . 
" I slumped back into my chair , defeated . It was useless . I could defeat the armies of Mars and save Pluto from near destruction , but I could n't correct one high-school English teacher unless I gave away my secret identity . "
" Oh , well . I 'd just have to prove him wrong in the next volume of Nebu-lad .
Sometimes I hate my job . "
" Oh , the work itself is n't bad , it 's the travel . By now , I 've probably got enough frequent flyer miles to spend the rest of my life in the sky . Yeah , right . As if my job would give me the time off . As if I had the money to do anything else . Jetsetting around the world for the biggest concern around , it ought to be glamorous , right ? "
 Nope . 
" God , I feel like an ass . I ought to be grateful . I 've seen most all of the great wonders of the world . I 've been to pretty much every tourist trap there is , and all on the company dime . I 've seen and done things that most people would n't even believe . So why does my life feel so empty ? "
 Because I made it empty . 
" And there it was . The truth I 'd been trying this whole flight not to think . That I did this to myself . I 'd left my friends behind , a long time ago . Now , my life was filled with co-workers , associates , clients . I had done it to myself . "
" I was n't there when my son was born . I chose the job . I was n't there for most of his childhood , other than cleaning up after his pets . I had n't even seen him since his mother died . His mother . Not my wife , though she had been . I 'd let that relationship die too . The boy was living with her parents now . "
 I was supposed to see him today . What would he say ? Would he even recognize me ? Would he be angry at me for not being there ? What would I say ? 
 Would he be angry at me ? I still did n't even know if I was angry at me . 
" But we 've arrived , and it 's time for me to meet the son I barely knew . "
" I see him there , waiting for me . I see him looking for me . He 's not scowling . That 's something , at least . "
 `` Son . '' 
 `` Dad . '' 
" We look at each other for a small eternity , not quite sure how to proceed . If I stop now , I wo n't be able to go through with this , so I muster the courage to speak . "
 `` You know I 'm sorry about your mother . '' 
 Crap . That was n't what I meant to say . 
" `` Yeah , Dad . I know . '' "
 `` You saw ? '' 
 `` Yeah . I saw . '' 
" `` It 's time , son . '' "
 He draws back . `` Me ? '' 
" `` You 've seen how it works . You 're my son , you can do this . Take my hand . '' "
" He takes my hand , and I go limp . I fall against him , sliding to the floor , but he 's still holding me . He guides me to the other side , just like he saw me do with his mother . Just like I 've done so many times . "
" And I 'm finally free .
Simon kicked at the dirt nervously as he worked up the courage to speak . `` A-ahem . Umm . Well that escalated quite , ummm , q-quickly . '' Simon stole a quick glance around and saw mostly downcast glances and a few quick nods . <newline> Simon paused before continuing . He decided it best not recount the hell that they all lived through . Simon did n't have to be a religious man to realize that they had all just survived the apocalypse . <newline> He was n't eager to relive the showers of blood and screams of agony as nearly everyone around him met their grim demise . It was so horrifying that he even felt a pang of sympathy shoot through his fear as his workplace bully , Andy , was sucked into the fiery pits of hell . <newline> He now found himself in a vast field surrounded by people as shell shocked as himself . <newline> However , as he surveyed them for the first time , he began to find comfort . Beyond their masks of fear he saw kindred spirits . He knew just by their demeanor that , like him , they were the beaten down , the unassuming , the ignored , the bullied , the kind hearted , the taken for granted . The meek , he realized . And they had inherited the earth . "
" `` Y-yeah . Soooo . I guess we should , umm , do some stuff . '' "
 A few more subtle nods .

The hardest part of pulling off a bank robbery is making sure Cory has his shit together . I watch as his bandanna bounces , sliding down the ridge of his nose as our van hits every pothole in Oklahoma . "
" `` That 's too loose , Cory . Here , turn your head . '' "
" I reach up and pull the knot on his vale a little tighter . As I let go , he turns to me and cocks his head slightly to the side . "
" `` Yeah , it 's good now . '' "
" He nods , then lays back on the blanket covering the cargo area . I slide my Nixon mask down over my head , and I can taste the rubber in my nostrils . From the front of the van , I hear three distinct knocks . "
" `` Almost there , guys , get ready . '' "
" I 'm calling this robbery as if I 'm some sort of ringleader . But aside from liquor stores and gas stations , I 've never done a big holdup before . Bruce , he 's shot someone in the leg once , but never done any time for it . Cory , well , he 's eager and dumb . Greg is our driver , he 's covered in tats . We figure he 's the last one we want in a clear camera view , so he 's staying in the van . And then there 's me . "
" The van rolls to a stop . I can feel it take the curb a bit , and lurch up in response . Cory hops up on the balls of his feet , pressing against the back door of the van . Bruce chambers a round in his pistol . And I swallow the acid in my stomach and act like I 'm the coach of a football team . "
" `` Alright . In and out . This is a nicer part of town , so no Plexiglas between us and the tellers . But also , it means the cops will give a shit . So let 's make this fast . Roll out ! '' "
" Great , I just quoted the Transformer movie . I 'm just brilliant . "
" Cory opens the door , and we pour out as the light floods in . Just six quick steps up the concrete stairs , and WHAT THE HELL ? "
 The alarm is going off already . I hear a high-pitched shrill . Cory instinctively puts his hands up to his ears . 
 `` The fuck you doing ? '' Bruce 's reaction is priceless . `` I thought you were a bad ass . What kind of bad ass covers his ears when a fire alarm goes off ? '' 
" The doors open wide , and reactions take over . It 's a bloodbath , and no one is coming away clean . Maybe one day , I 'll say that I thought they were security guards . I mean logically , they 're armed , what else would you expect ? But in that moment , my thoughts did n't use language . My thoughts used ammunition . And I was brainstorming away . "
" In the commotion , I knew only a few things . "
" Cory shot himself in the head . He went from covering his ears to adjusting his mask , and he had a hold of his gun the whole time . His shot was one of the first fired . "
" Bruce shot two people . Well , no , actually . He shot one person , in two legs . Then his face fell to the ground in a red blur . "
" I kept firing at anything in front of me , until my gun 's 'bang ' turned into 'click ' and the hammer struck empty . The sounds of the alarm now mixed with moans . Everyone had been shot except for Greg and me . Greg and I . Whatever , you know what I mean . Fuck you , I just got shot at . "
" So anyway , there 's two bags of money , and no one to claim them . "
 `` You fuckers tried to rob MY bank ? Fucking unbelievable . '' 
" Maybe this is the first bank robbery in the history of mankind where the money gets dropped off curbside ? In any event , I 'm ready to get away from the scene of our crimes . "
" I hop in the van , which by some miracle has n't left yet . Greg guns it . Seven blocks to the other car we stashed . I 'm also acutely aware that I have no bullets left . I ease myself further into the passenger seat , away from the driver . "
" We turn a few corners , racing to the stolen Honda parked just at the end of this street . Something got the better part of Greg , and he ran into our second getaway car . The bumper on the little Civic cracked and busted like peanut brittle . He sounded drunk , slurring his words as he turned to me . "
" `` You sound like you 're speaking in cursive , I ca n't understand you . '' "
" Blood gurgls out of his mouth , and also from the knife wound in his neck . I twist as I pulled the blade , for good measure . "

The sign on the ground was unintelligible , most of the letters had been burned off a long time ago . At the edges he could see what remained of a blue background . Well that was something . This splintered and jagged road had been a motorway once . He had guessed as much , but you could never be really sure . A flyover was mostly still standing , and he decided it was worth risking walking up it to get a view of the landscape . He started towards it , keeping to the grass verge of the road . The tarmac and concrete had been torn up into sharp chunks by the persistency of the plant life , making the road treacherous . Here and there were cars , rusted and dented . After the bombs had gone off a lot of people tried to get away from the cities , fearing more were on their way . But no more came . He could only assume that the long touted promise of mutually assured destruction had come true . "
" At the time he had been living in a village called Blyth . It was a small place , and after a few weeks the people there started to leave and find their way to other places , places where help must have arrived . Only the elderly or sick had stayed . He himself had packed for a long journey and was ready to leave when those same people started coming back to the village . There had been no help , and things in the larger towns and cities were dire . Mass illness , mass crime , mass starvation . Gangs ruled and fought for land with a clean water source or food . <newline> In response to this , they had barricaded parts of the village and set up lookouts . They had fashioned weapons from anything they could , and local farmers had brought their guns and ammunition and had trained people how to look after and fire them . No attack ever came . "
" A few people wandered by , alone or in small groups , and were allowed in to stay , if they so wished . One group had evidently brought the plague . People started getting a fever , this was followed by large purple welts on their body , and eventually they would fit and die or fall in to a coma , which was no better . One of the first people to succumb was the doctor , and of course that only made things worse . He and a few others sectioned themselves off . The whole village actually broke down into small groups of people . The idea being that if the sickness was in a group , it at least would be harder to spread to the others . And anyone with signs of illness went to the hall . He only knew of one person who had recovered , and she cared for the sick , the only one presumed to now be immune . Out of all of the groups , only two survived . One of which was obviously his . "
" They had all decided to leave . The village smelled of decaying bodies and was clearly uninhabitable . <newline> He and another man were heading south . The man had gone his own way into Nottingham , and he had turned to go around it . It added time to his route , but he really didn ’ t want to see the city . <newline> Finding this was a motorway would mean that this was the M1 . He could follow this straight down to London , if he so wished . But he didn ’ t wish , he would turn off before then and head to the south coast . It was , he knew , quite built up there . But he hoped to avoid most of it . If he could get to the coast somewhere west of Portsmouth , he could take a boat to the Isle of Wight . It relied on him finding a boat , sure , but there were bound to be plenty of them out that way . He didn ’ t know how long it would take , but he guessed at weeks . But , after the last few years stuck in a remote village , he was desperate to see if his wife and children were still alive . <newline>
The room sat several thousands of people , centered around an holographic display on a stage . No one needed to present , one person was in charge of moving the holographs around , revealing dozens of images of the worlds beyond this solar system . "
" No man has ever set foot beyond Jupiter , yet they managed to send five-hundred thousand robots to fly to other solar systems in the galaxy . Why waste a life or a few thousands just to fly in space of nothing for a few several hundred months when they could send robots who can do the job just as well , if not better and faster ? "
" On these displays held the attention of all in the room . Only a team of four people had seen them before , and now many thousands will see them for the first time . All the robots had reached their destinations and discovered a few worlds in each system . The robots were sent to solar systems containing Earth-like planets and have them investigate the surface of these places . "
" People began to murmur when they saw a tower on planet Gaea . The murmuring increased as more buildings revealed themselves on other planets . Several dozen of planets appeared and disappeared in the air on the holographic display . Each planet stayed in the air for five minutes , zooming in closer to the surface and out to see the entire planet again . "
" The last planet faded from view two hours later , and the room fell silent again , most people shocked and stunned by what they saw . "
 `` What is the meaning of this ? '' one person asked in the front row seat . A scientist who helped launch the robots . 
" Like a spell , the room burst into loud conversations—debates , expressions of shock , questions being asked , and no response could satisfy them all . "
" A loud gonging sound rang through the stadium seating style room , and the audience fell into a hushed whispers , unable to stop themselves from discussing the planets they viewed . "
" `` This , ladies and gentlemen , is the proof that we are not alone , '' he said , showing one planet . As he continued to talk , the planet rotated . `` The thing is , all of these planets show the buildings in ruin . No one is alive . They 're all dead planets . '' "
 `` But why are they all in ruins ? How do we know for sure they are not hiding ? '' 
" `` We have been examining the planets for a year , '' he answered . `` There have been no movement . On all 428 planets . Of the 500 we sent , only 72 did not make it to their destinations . Of the 52 planets , there were no ruins found . The rest… 376 planets , they all had buildings—as you saw them . Houses , large buildings , towers , roads . Even pools . Yet , none of them had anyone walk around . Drive a vehicle . There are , however , life forms , animals if you will , moving around . Acting the very same way Earth 's animals move to eat , to fight , and to sleep . They are not intelligent as they never used any of the buildings for themselves . "
" `` Ladies and gentlemen , I present you another evidence . They all committed suicide . Mass suicides . '' "
" He pressed a button and it zoomed in to a building . The people could clearly see bodies on the ground outside the building , each of them holding a weapon very similar to a gun and aimed at themselves . "
" Another image showed similar scene , bodies with weapons aimed at themselves . The bodies on both planets were skeletons . The animals had not gotten to them on any of the planets . "
 The crowd was silent again . 
" `` Does this mean… whatever happened to them , will happen to us ? '' the same questioner asked . "
" `` That , sir , is the question we want to ask . The real questions are : why ? What happened ? How ? What can we do to prevent this from happening ? Anyone have a guess ? '' "
" The place was quiet , waiting for some brave soul to answer . Three minutes , still no one stepped forward to hazard a guess . "
" `` Lucky for you , I do have the answers to them , '' he said , his expression growing grave as he continued to talk . `` What is amazing is not the ruins themselves , or the bodies . Or the fact that we are not alone . What is amazing is what drove them to killing themselves . Every last , '' he switched to another planet , `` one , '' another planet , `` of , '' another planet , `` these have been threatened with the space ships that came to them . '' "
 A final holographic displayed showed a fleet of space ships flying past Jupiter . 
 `` They are slave traders . We have one week before they get here . '' 
" The room burst with anger words spewing out their feelings at this . Some of disbelief , of outrage , of despair . "
" `` We know this , '' his voice grew louder to be heard over the din , `` because we found 38 planets with ruins and they have

" `` It 's a shame about Tom , yeah ? '' One of the perpetual water cooler gossips asked to the person standing beside him . "
" `` Huh ? What happened to him ? '' . He asked , bending down to pull out a cup for himself . "
" `` Did n't you hear ? It was all over the news . '' The gossip paused , taking a sip from his own paper cup . `` Big rig slammed right into him on the interstate . Caused a five car pileup . '' "
" `` Oh , very funny guys . '' Tom said , adjusting his tie . `` I 'm pretty sure I 'd remember something like that . '' "
" The second man paused , his face scrunching up in thought . `` Is that why he 's not in work today ? Geez , any word on how he 's doing ? '' "
" Tom frowned , and crossed his arms , as the gossip shook his head sadly . `` Dead on impact . '' "
" Tom cleared his throat meaningfully . `` Okay , enough 's enough . It was n't that funny to begin with . "
" They continued to ignore him , though , as the second man looked towards the floor . `` Oh , wow . That 's ... that 's unfortunate . '' He paused for a moment , before looking back up at the gossip . `` If I can be totally honest , though ? I never really liked the guy . He seemed standoffish . '' "
" The gossip crossed his own arms . `` Really , Paul ? Not even a day and you 're already bad mouthing him ? Show some respect , man . '' "
" `` Yeah , I 'm right here . And I 'm not dead . '' He growled , looking between the two . "
" Paul shrugged . `` What ? I mean I 'm sorry for him and all , but that does n't change the fact that he was a bit of a jerk . '' "
" `` Well , can you blame him ? After all , you know he has n't been the same since his wife ... '' He trailed off , leaving the sentence hanging in the air . "
" `` Woah , now you 're going to far ! '' Tom shouted out at the gossip . "
" Paul nodded sadly . `` Yeah , I guess . Well , at least they 'll be together again . '' "
" Tom turned to Paul , his anger starting to flare . `` That 's it , I 've had enough with you assholes . '' He reached to grab Paul 's arm . `` You do n't even joke about ... wha- ? '' "
" He stared as his fingers passed through Paul 's arm . He pulled his arm back abruptly , waggling his digits in front of his face . He reached out with both arms , like a blind man grasping for something . His rage slowly turned to horror as his arms harmlessly went through Paul 's chest . "
 Paul shuddered . `` I just got the worst chill . '' 
" `` Hey , that means someone is walking over your grave . '' "
 Paul scowled at his compatriot . `` You need to work on your timing . '' 
" Tom was deaf to the squabbling that ensued . He placed his closed fists to his eyes as images began to flash through his head . The rear-view mirror , the rapidly approaching headlights . The world turning inside out . "
" Just then , he heard a voice call out behind him . `` Tom ? '' "
" He froze up . It was a voice he had heard before . All too familiar , but one he had not been able to hear in years . `` Amelia ? '' "
" He slowly turned , his hands falling from his face . There she stood , just as he remembered her . Her hair still long and full , her body unmarred from her illness . She just stood there , tears welling up in her eyes . A thin smile on her lips as his eyes fell on her . "
" `` I 'm here , Tom . '' She said , softly . "
" Tom rushed towards her , faster than he ever had run before . He wrapped his arms around her , his own tears flowing freely . `` Amelia . '' He whispered into her hair . "
" He did n't know how long they stood there , wrapped up in their embrace . He could have stood there forever . "
" Finally , he spoke again . `` I thought I lost you forever . '' "
" She pulled away just enough to look him in his face . `` I 'm here now , that 's all that matters . '' "
" He closed his eyes , looking away briefly . `` So I guess that means that I am ... '' "
" She nodded slowly . `` The first few hours are always the toughest . '' She pulled away from him , grasping him by the hand . "
" `` But I 'll explain it all to you later . Come on , it 's time
I size up the woman in front of me . Shiny gray spandex , long cape , one of those silly little masks on her face . The Silver Bullet , fastest woman in the world . Groan . "
" How will I wreck her ? There are lots of options with super-speed , as several of my late enemies can attest . Bolt died of starvation after expending a small city 's daily calorie intake in ten seconds . Zoomerang stripped the flesh from his own bones when he discovered air resistance . And Captain Velocity shattered his spine like a rabbit with a single overly-energetic kick . "
" I 'm not your average supervillain -- you know , I do n't even like that term . What I do is necessary . All these superheroes , they 're flashy and loveable , but they 're dangerous . Ask anyone to recount how Captain Adonis stopped Doctor Catastrophe from nuking Topeka , and you 'll be regaled with a forty-minute blow-by-blow epic . But they probably wo n't mention that the city was leveled anyway by the fighting . "
" All I do is bring these folks back to earth a little . I was born with the power , if you care to call it that , to reassert the laws of nature . I can break the convenient but unnatural circumvention of physics that other superheroes are born with -- typically to fatal effect . Ask Firebrand . "
 I take a step toward Silver Bullet . I imagine the contrast my dark three-piece suit must make with her ostentatious costume -- I like to think of myself as a little more practical than these superhero types . 
" `` Silver Bullet , '' I begin . `` You must know my reputation , and you must know there 's no way out of this for you . Give yourself up , and I promise you 'll be treated fairly . Confinement in the Tower of Penitence is better than death , you know . '' "
" The Tower of Penitence is where I keep all the superheroes who surrender to me . Well , where I would keep them if they did surrender . It 's empty . "
" She looks at me with what seems to be pity . Overconfidence , the one constant of that varied crew . `` I 'd extend you the same offer . This does n't have to end in violence . '' "
" `` I 'm sorry to hear that , '' I reply . `` In that case , I suppose -- '' "
" A loud crack shatters the still air , and I freeze . Her speed -- worked ? How ... "
" I feel a pain in my abdomen , where she must have punched me . I stagger back , jaw agape . This is impossible . I look up , falling to my knees in shock ... and see Silver Bullet holstering her gun .
The wizard Nadir and his knight-errant , Parallax , stood , stunned , above the corpse of the greater stone golem . The golem ’ s corpse lay across the flat earth of the desert . A wind whipped at the cloth of Nadir ’ s robe , and curved across the armor of Parallax . Parallax ’ s chest heaved up and down , exhausted from the battle with the golem . Nadir ’ s hands were covered in soot and stains , a byproduct of the magic he ’ d used . The two stood side by side , and stared down at the treasure the golem had been protecting . "
" “ What is it ? ” Parallax asked , sheathing her sword . "
 “ I don ’ t … I don ’ t quite know. ” Nadir replied . 
" The two were staring at a small , brown bag the golem seemed to have coveted . They ’ d opened the bag , and inside had been a brown disk , flat and circular . The brown disk seemed to have the quality of a burnt baked good ; flakes and ripples covered its surface . Currently , the disk sat next to the opened brown bag , both the wizard and the knight nervous about touching such a strange artifact . "
" “ What do you mean you don ’ t know ? ” Parallax asked , turning her head towards Nadir . “ I thought you were a master of the occult. ” "
" “ W-w-well of course I am ! ” Nadir stuttered out , his face turning read . “ But this isn ’ t occult . Nothing , none of my tomes or scrolls have ever mentioned something like this. ” Nadir said , gesturing madly at the flaking brown wafter sitting at their feet . "
" The two turned their attention back to their loot . They stood in silence for a few moments , trying to come to a conclusion . Nadir ’ s mind ran and sprinted through his expansive knowledge of the occult magicks . Nothing was of use . As for Parallax , she looked back on her experiences . She had travelled the land , fought countless monsters and demons , goblins and ghouls , explored countless dungeons and caverns , abandoned forts and ruins . Yet nothing she had seen came close to this bizarre wafer . In a way , it reminded her of overcooked bread , but what would a stone golem be doing with a pastry . "
" “ We don ’ t have much time to waste . We need to meet up with Aphelion before the light wanes to the night. ” Nadir spoke up , breaking the silence . “ It ’ s obvious it ’ s food . Go pick it up , and try some Parallax , then we can finally solve this mystery and be on our way. ” "
" Parallax bulked . “ Why me ? And how do you know it ’ s food even . Why don ’ t you pick it up and try some ? ” She replied , incredulous . "
" “ Because I ’ m paying you , that ’ s why. ” Nadir said . "
 “ Not enough to risk my life on some poisoned trap. ” Parallax replied . 
" Nadir thought for a moment . He stroked his chin , and his mind tumbled through all sorts of devious plans and manipulations . Finally , He settled on a plan of attack to trick Parallax into eating the strange brown wafer . "
" “ I ’ ll give you fifty gold pieces to eat it. ” Nadir replied ; a small , devious smile on the wizard ’ s lips . "
" Parallax went to argue , but stopped herself . She thought about Nadir ’ s offer for a moment , and weighed her chances . With a shrug , she bent down to pick up the wafter . It felt soft in her hands , and bits of the top flaked off in the wind of the desert . "
" She brought the wafer up to her face . She stared at it for a moment , steeling herself . With the thought of fifty gold pieces in her mind , and all that the money could buy , she took a bite , suddenly and quickly , diving in , trying not to think of the consequences . Her teeth tore easily into the soft wafer , and soon a piece was being chewed up in her mouth . "
" The horror and trepidation Parallax had felt were soon replaced by surprise and delight . The brown wafer inside of her mouth tasted delicious . It was soft , moist , sugary , chocolatey , savory . It seemed to be some sort of bread or pastry , unknown to the realm of the humans . Parallax savored the bite , and reluctantly swallowed . Her eyes were wide in pleasure . "
" “ So , how is it ? ” Nadir asked , anxious to know . "
" Startled , Parallax shook her head . She put on a sour look , and faced Nadir . “ It is … quite awful . Foul and disgusting ; unholy even. ” She replied , putting the brown wafer into a small pocket . “ It must be burned . I ’ ll dispose of it as soon as we set up camp for the night. ” "
 Nadir nodded his head in thought . “ Hmm . A shame . I wonder why a stone golem would be hiding something so awful. ”

 I frantically search my pockets only to find a few hundreds in each .

He was sitting across from the girl at a small pink table that was worse for wear . It was marked with crayon scribbles and covered in dings and dirt . The chair he was sitting in was far too small for him and the girl looked like she was about to outgrow her chair as well , though he imagined that the barbie dolls in the remaining two seats would never have such a problem .

 Delaney poured the Devil another cup of imaginary tea . 
" “ That ’ s just the way things are. ” The Devil was explaining . “ Collecting souls , keeping count , getting all ready for the final battle and all. ” "
" “ But why ? ” The girl insisted . The Devil stared down into his empty plastic cup . The girl poured herself a cup next and the Devil noted how polite it was of her to serve her guest first , even if there wasn ’ t really any tea involved . "
 “ Just because is all. ” 
 “ That ’ s what adults say when they don ’ t know. ” Delaney pointed out and the Devil frowned . Smart kid . 
" “ Look it ’ s been like this for ages , alright ? You ’ ve got to have the bad to appreciate the good , right ? To test the good and to punish the wicked. ” "
 “ But why ? Why fight and be angry and make people bad and all that ? Do you like being mad at people and making them do bad things ? ” 
" “ Well no I don ’ t like it , but that doesn ’ t matter does it ? If I don ’ t do my job the entire cosmic balance will just fall apart. ” "
" “ Will it , though ? ” Delaney took a sip from her cup while the Devil pondered this and when he didn ’ t respond the girl continued . “ It ’ s like broccoli. ” "
 “ What ? ” Clearly the Devil wasn ’ t following her logic . 
" “ Momma told me that I wouldn ’ t know if I liked broccoli until I tried it . I tried it and it ’ s okay as long as it ’ s covered in cheese and I only have to eat the tops . But the point is you ’ ll never know until you try , right ? And besides if it ’ s not fun , why do it in the first place ? ” "
 “ Well because ... it ’ s my Job. ” 
 “ Who is your boss ? ” 
 “ What ? ” 
 “ Who ’ s your boss ? ” 
 “ Well I ’ m the boss. ” 
 “ So there ’ s no one telling you what to do ? ” 
 “ Well ... ” 
" “ More tea ? ” She smiled at him and he extended his cup . “ I ’ m just saying that if you don ’ t like what you do and it makes you mad then maybe you should stop . No one is telling you you have to stay so the only one keeping you there is you , right ? Momma tells me when I ’ m angry that all being angry does is makes me angry . What would make you happy ? ” "
 The Devil sipped his imaginary tea . He hadn ’ t given it much thought . 
 “ You know ... I ’ ve always wanted to go ice skating. ”

I remember hearing about it on the news in the morning it happened . Everyone was calling it `` The Clearing . '' I had known something was wrong when I could feel the warm sunlight on my face in the morning right before getting up . I 'll never forget rushing down the stairs , scrambling to put on my air-filtration mask , and bursting out the front door onto our lawn . I could see the Sun shining brightly in the sky , birds flying overhead , and mountains in the distance breaking the horizon in jagged peaks . "
 I looked over the light blue fence into the Ericsons ' yard and found them staring at the sky with similar looks of wonder and bewilderment . `` How did this happen ? '' I questioned . Their youngest son Timmy was crawling around in the grass playing with their Scottish Terrier . `` Why is n't Timmy wearing his face mask ? '' I exclaimed . 
" `` They said it 's safe to take off our face masks , '' Timmy 's mother yelled back laughing . `` The air smells so fresh . The sky looks so beautiful , '' she sighed , closing her eyes and leaning on her husband 's shoulder . "
" That was a month ago , and things have n't been the same since . Ever since the government made face masks optional , more people have been walking outside without them . Once , I took off my mask for a few seconds and took a deep breath in , and I could n't tell the difference between the artificial fresh air our masks released and the natural fresh air . My mother scolded me when I told her , she said it was sinful and blasphemous . "
" News channels and newspapers were all speculating absurd theories – a government experiment gone wrong , an extraterrestrial visit , the coming of the apocalypse . Even scientists were unsure how to explain the occurrence . Apparently , the global temperature was dropping rapidly and the Arctic Circle was rapidly freezing . My parents even said we could move back to the coast since the water levels from the coasts were receding at a faster pace than ever . "
" But life goes on as normal – I still have to wake up early on weekdays to make the school bus , I still have to sit through boring classes like math and history , where I 'll learn about algebra and how God created man on the seventh day , the day after he created the fog . "

At the beginning of the 20th Century , when the automobile was still new , gasoline engines were but one of the many technologies vying for dominance . Some early cars were electric , some ran on boilers fueled by burning coal or wood . "
" When Henry Ford opened his first factory in Detroit , the tri-state region of Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio was coincidentally taking off as a major player in the nascent dairy farming industry . ( Michigan is still one of the top ten dairy producers ) Prior to the turn of the century , family farms ruled as the modern process of Pasteurization had not yet existed . "
 It 's a little known fact that Henry Ford kept a sizable herd of cows on a farm just outside of Dearborn for the sole purpose of capturing and using the methane produced as a source of fuel . Several Model T prototypes exist to this day with tanks designed to hold compressed methane gas . 
" Fortunately , the process proved to be more costly at the time than traditional gasoline . If not , we might still be driving around today in cars powered by cow farts . "

`` Shit , '' I muttered . I woke up late for work again today . My paranoia has been settling in recently . My eyes remain glued to the television for hours watching the news every day . I 'm losing sleep over it . The Russians have flooded to us here in the U.S. and China has claimed Antarctica , shipping missiles over to it , to presumably launch from should anything trigger a nuclear response from them . "
 The Russians have been coming over in droves for about twenty years now . There has been a resource crisis going on for five . Do they know something ? 
" I hopped in my car to go to work and turned on the radio . On the highway I hit traffic , of course . Dead stop . The radio gets an interruption with an emergency broadcast . The Russians have began isolated attacks in the U.S. "
 Now I do n't know if I 'm sitting in traffic or fear . 
 I put down my window and peek out to see if I can see anything causing this traffic when a huge blast about seven cars ahead shattered my windshield and knocked me out . 
 I awoke what was probably twenty minutes later . 
" Disoriented , I open my eyes . A huge pillar of smoke is reaching the top of the trees that border the highway . This is when I feel a severe pain in my arm . I look at it and notice a bend in my forearm , it 's badly broken . My car has slid back a good fifteen feet and is now crooked . About a minute later my hearing is starting to return but is still muffled . The first sounds I heard was screaming . It looks like other cars around me got it much worse . There was a larger car in front of me that may have shielded some of the blast . "
 I step out of my car and look towards the billowing smoke . There are about five men equipped with what looks like automatic rifles standing near the origin of the flames . I ca n't see anything else besides this . 
 `` Are they military ? '' I thought . 
 When I got back in my car I started it up again without any problems . I guess this will be the only good thing to happen today . 
" I begin to drive through the wreckage of other cars carefully . All their windows were blown out as well . Peering into some vehicles I did n't see a lot of motion . I was telling myself they were all just knocked out like I was , but I knew otherwise . When I got closer to where the blast originated I saw a charred car . The men holding the rifles saw me driving and ordered me to stop . There 's a lot of firepower there so I was n't taking any chances . "
" They asked me with what sounded like a Russian accent , `` How much gas you have in tank ? '' "
 `` I 'm at a quarter of a tank full . '' I reply . I never really get too much in there because of prices now and the shortage . Did they want to leave the scene ? 
 I glanced to my right and saw one of the other guys with them pull out a hose from a backpack and open another cars ' gas door . He began syphoning their gas into a tank of their own . He was going car to car doing this . 
" I was snapped back to attention when I heard , `` Give us what we want and no problems , okay ? '' "
 `` Okay '' naturally comes out when you have a gun in your face and asked a question like this . 
 One of the others walked up to him and whispered something to him . All I saw was a head nod in response . That 's when I started hearing the unmistakable sound of gunshots . They were killing any witnesses . 
 In a panic I ducked down below the steering wheel and slammed the gas . I definitely hit the guy that was holding me hostage as well as pin-balling off of some cars along the way . I heard my car getting hit by their fire . 
 I got off the next exit and started heading back home . How I made it out of there I 'll never know . 
" Now is not the time for thinking , now is the time for preparation . This has only just begun .
“ Who can replace Death ? He was the most feared of us all . Without Death there can be no reckoning upon the sinful mortals. ” "
" War scratched his thinning beard . He was running out of options . No others had dared to take up such a heavy burden . While War was no stranger to the horrors of , he shuddered to think about the atrocities that Death had committed . Was there any being in the 7 realms to take up the Cloak and Scythe ? "
 “ But there is someone. ” hissed Famine . 
" “ Brothers you are aware that all the atrocities we have committed were dealt by Man . War , death , famine and conquest . These were all Man ’ s undoing . Who else better to don the burden of Death then a man himself ? ” "
" Famine ’ s ragged hood covered his face , only showing his decaying mouth twisted in a sick smile . "
 Conquest was quick to challenge . 
" <newline> “ Man , donning the very bane of his existence ? Brother , your imprudence will be the end of us all . A mortal man is hideous creature . He is greedy , selfish and cruel . Giving one this much power will only result in abuse. ” "
" <newline> “ Conquest , you are as foolish as ever . Have you learnt nothing from Death ? He was the wisest of us all , he- ” "
" “ If Death was so wise , explain his abrupt departure . Why did he leave his duties behind ? We are the horsemen of the apocalypse ; both terrible and glorious . When the Horn of the Heavens sounds we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners . It is who we are . Death was a fool for leaving. ” "
" “ ENOUGH ! ” <newline> War slammed into Conquest , knocking him down to the brimstone . He unleashed an onslaught of blows onto his golden armor until it was dented beyond recognition . Breathless , War stood up towering over his foe and boomed . "
 “ I will not take this insolence . Death was the best of us . I loved him as a brother and a mentor. ” 
 War ’ s stone face softened for a second . 
" “ Should you be stupid enough to blaspheme our brother again , I will end you. ” "
 Conquest nodded in shame . He was not used to the bitter taste of defeat . He silently vowed that War would pay for the humiliation he suffered . 
 “ Famine . You say that a mortal can replace Death . Bring him to me. ”

**NOTE : ** I have barely any knowledge whatsoever of the workings of the human genome . Do not accept *anything* said here as fact regarding the human genome , although certain individual parts may be correct . "

" There have always been portions of the human genome that do n't seem to actually affect anything . A few years back , when the bill that allowed gene modification on fertilized human embryos was passed , several other geneticists and I went *crazy* changing these . It did n't seem to do a thing . Even if we put *random* data in those `` cruft '' ( as we called them ) parts , the people would turn out the same . But recently , I had noticed something interesting . Since I used to be a computer scientist , before I became a geneticist , the way I look at things is sometimes very different from that of my colleagues , and recently I had started comparing different people 's genomes . What 's the difference between the genome of a tall , white , blonde , blue-eyed white woman , and a short , dark-haired , brown-eyed black man ? Again and again , every time , only one thing was consistent between *everyone* . The cruft . So I logged into the international database of human genetics and used up all of my queries for the year ( it 's kind of sickening , actually : there 's a set limit on the number of queries you can make per year to the website , and then it 's based off of microtransactions ) comparing the cruft on 16,774 different human genomes . All the same . Perhaps it was just coincidence , but I had to be sure . I loaded up the entirety of the cruft into one file , and looked at it . It looked ... normal . Random . It looked like DNA . Then , by a sudden sudden burst of inspiration , I ran a reverse-base4 one it . The resultant file was , apparently , a standards-compliant ISO file ? That did n't sound right . I mounted it and looked inside . There was a single file , named `README.txt` , and a single folder , named `src/` . What the hell was this witchcraft ? "

" Huh . I looked inside `src/` , which contained the source code to this `` dna '' program , and according to the parser ... a `` creation-dev-ice '' was identical to one of our modern 3-D printers ! "
" I knew it was expensive , and I was just a poor lab-worker , but I did n't care . I had to try this software out . I shelled out for the most expensive 3-D printer I could find , hooked it up to my computer , and ran the dna program on `example.and` , in `src/` . It gave me various messages as it ran , and eventually the 3-D printer started up . And it was *loud* . I had tested it out a few times before , and it had been relatively loud , but not as loud as this . I did n't dare leave it alone long enough to go to the store and buy some ear plugs , but I desperately wanted to . My computer began to get visibly hot , despite being state-of-the-art liquid-nitrogen-cooled . I shielded my eyes and looked right at the bottom of the screen , where the indicator read 90 % finished . Almost ... almost ... you can do it . Until two error messages showed up in bright red : "

" And what stepped out of the 3-D printer a few seconds a later is a monstrosity I will not bear to describe . Suffice to say it was the most awful , ferocious , disgusting beast known to mankind . With all the intelligence of a human , with none of the conscience ; with all the ferociousness of the tiger , with none of the discretion . And five more such as these stepped out of the printer . I shrieked and ran . "

`` Your what ? Your heart 's gon na give out ? Believe me Chancellor , I 'll think you 'll live for a bit more . A little exercise is n't going to do you any harm . In fact , you likely need a bit more than a little . '' "
" `` I beg your pardon , '' the planetary governor stammered , his pasty white flesh reddening in outrage . He was silenced from speaking more at the sight of the other man 's upraised hand , the fingers clenched into a fist . "
" `` Chancellor , pretty soon my men and women will be dying to protect yours . The least you can do is show them your gratitude . '' "
" `` Major Novak , '' the older man said wiping at a bit of sweat that beaded on his forehead . `` It 's not that I am ungrateful for your Grave Guards coming to our world 's aid , it 's merely that I am a very busy man and the demands of my position require that certain individuals be seen to as soon as possible .

 Major Tycho Novak chuckled grimly at that before opening a door and ushering the planetary governor outside . 
" `` Chancellor , if you 're dead you do n't have to worry about those kinds of people . So it might be better for your well being if you worry about the here and now , hmm ? '' "
" The door as it turned out opened to the balcony overlooking a broad parade ground , the grey cement covered with yellow and white lines to mark out distances and paths . Arrayed on it in neat lines were the soldiers and personnel of the Grave Guards , all dressed in their olive green coveralls and splinter camouflaged field jackets . Battle armor troopers wore their suits , forming a solid block of steel . Mechwarriors stood in front of their machines , the metal titans painted grey with black trim . Tankers stood next to their vehicles which proudly displayed their number of kills on the barrels of their guns . Overhead zoomed a squadron of six aerospace fighters , the roar of their engines deafening to the ears . "
" `` The Grave Guards , Chancellor , have yet to lose a defensive campaign . Twenty battlemechs , four tanks , eighty battle armor troopers and a full squadron of fighters . They are at your side though not your disposal . A mercenary commander 's capital is his men and I will not be frivolous in spending the lives of the men and women I consider family . They will do whatever I ask of them , the trust between me and them absolute . We will win , I just want to make sure it costs us as little as possible in pursuit of that victory . ''
<newline> The Prince and the princess "
" There once was a prince who loved a princess . But it was not to be , because this princess was already betrothed to another . But this prince could see that this princess was not truly happy . She was married to a dragon and her and that dragon were able to sire two children together . But as you know , the offspring of a dragon and a human is a demon . Now most people think demons are these horned creatures that go around creating misdeeds and causing havoc but that 's not what demons do . Demons look just like any other person except they enjoy suffering . You see , unlike a regular person , demons love to see human beings suffer . I guess , that just makes sense given that so few demons are spawned by acts of love . Maybe demons are n't inherently bad . they 're just nurtured that way . "
" Regardless , the prince saw this and he wanted to do something about it . What I have n't mentioned before is that this prince was actually also a knight . Hed also slain many demons but never a dragon . Demons are relatively easy to vanquish , but a dragon is a great accomplishment . The kind of accomplishment that so few knights are capable of doing but he was , because he was one of the greatest knights in the land . "
" The princess used to pretend she was happy . But the prince could see how unhappy she really was . When he would watch from the window , when she was all alone , away from the demons and the dragon , he could see her true sadness . The sadness that only the brave and handsome prince , the strong knight , would ever be able to chase away . "
" So one day , the prince entered where the dragon and demons lived . He was armed with a crossbow and an axe . Most knights would have used a sword but this particular night was fond of using axes because it 's only with an axe that a true warrior attains a higher state of being . As he entered the door to the castle , he saw the dragon , the demons and the princess all eating dinner . The princess , of course , was pretending to be happy but the knight nnew better . Away the bolt flew from his crossbow and into the heart of the dragon , . The dragon stood up , trying to face down the knight but before he could the knight brought down the axe into his skull . "
" Seeing what a mighty warrior he was , the two demons began cowering and crying . They called out to their mother and the princess went to them , possibly still scared of what those demons would do to her . Knowing that the dragon ’ s magic was strong , the knight pulled the princess away from the demons and slew them where they laid cowering on the floor . "
" The princess was traumatized . So many years and for so long , she had lived under the yoke of the dragon and the demons . She did n't know how to live a normal life . She did n't know true love . But now she would . "
 The prince pulled her into his arms and she began fighting him . The dragon ’ s magic was too strong . The prince knew that the only way that the dragon ’ s magic could be conquered was with love . So the prince threw his love over his shoulder and took her back to his castle . 
" Back at the castle , the situation seemed hopeless . Despite the prince ’ s boundless love for the princess , the dragon ’ s magic was just too strong . She continued to fight the prince . Numerous times , she attempted to escape . At one point , she even got to a local farmer and the dragon ’ s magic started to infect the man so the knight struck him down before he could be corrupted completely . "
" It was then that knight realized that the princess , the love of his life , would need to be chained . Just like in Snow White , his love would awaken something inside of her but first she would need to stop fighting it . The prince chained the princess to her bed . The prince knew that what he was doing was unpleasant but no matter how confined her physical form may be , nothing could stop their love for one another . "
" Every morning and every night , the prince would enter the princess 's room and expresses his love towards her . This continued for what seemed like ages until a miracle happened . "
" The princess was with a child . This was wonderful news . Just like the way a dragon creates a demon , a knight , being an instrument of God 's will , produces only angels . "
" Now , I 've told you this story every night for the past year-and-a-half , my love . and I know the dragon ’ s magic still courses through your veins but I want to know what kind of ceremony you would like for our wedding . As you know , your marriage to the dragon was over as soon as I crushed his skull with my axe , so there 's nothing keeping you from being my bride forever , now is there ? "

Teddy 's eyes sparkle with excitement as he rummages enthusiastically and yet somehow reverently through the dusty and scuffed red leather suitcase , the case releases the warm scent of pipe tobacco , small hands lifting stacks of somehow unfaded paper . `` Look at this one dad ! '' he says , waving the old magazine , a copy of Amazing stories . The garishly illustrated cover depicting a towering , glinting robot brandishing a finned ray gun and looming menacingly over an improbably breasted swooning girl drooping in the arms of a lantern jawed Flash Gordon knockoff . `` SHOCKING vision of the future depicts humanity as SLAVES to artificial intelligence ! Wow ! Awesome ! '' I ruffle his hair and he smiles back up at me . `` I remember reading all these as a kid myself . I did n't know dad had kept them all these years . '' My eyes naturally wander to the mantle , a photograph in a simple silver frame . Me , dad and a largemouth Bass held between us . Both of us wearing identical stupid grins , I with a beer in my free hand , dad with his pipe . "
" I can still smell his pipe as I hear his voice across the years . `` Son , I am so damned proud of you . I know I have n't been there as much as maybe I could have been , but you 've grown into a fine man . '' His eyes swim behind his glasses a little . `` Come on dad , how many of those beers have you had ? '' I laugh . I was young , I did n't understand . His voice cracks a little . `` I just wanted you to know son . You 'll come to realise that someday it all ends and that if you have n't said what needs to be said , well , that 's something that can never be undone . '' He blinks and pokes his pipe into the corner of his mouth with a hand that trembles slightly . The only sound is the quiet burble of the river as we sit in companionable silence for a while , broken by the plink of the fishing float being pulled under and the ratcheting click of the reel . `` Get that net ready boy , we got a bite , and she 's a big 'un ! One for the album , you bet ! '' "
" That 's the thing about clearing a loved ones house . So many memories , waiting to ambush you without warning . A tiny blue porcelain vase with a chip in the rim , a small brass cup engraved `` Worlds best fisherman '' , a walnut handled pocket knife . Things that mean nothing to anyone else , but I know them all intimately . I watch my boy as he goes through the case , savouring the fantastical artwork of the covers and neatly piling the stacks of pulp magazines by title , so like his grandfather , so like me . I remember reading my stories , my sheets tented above my head and my Thunderbirds lantern casting its glow over the pages . Living for an hour or so as an intrepid space adventurer , or a swashbuckling pirate until finally falling asleep and dreaming a childs dreams of heroism and adventure . The scent of pipesmoke and cedar shavings entwined with warm memory . "

" `` Son , `` I say , `` I think your grandpa would have wanted you to have those with his love , and mine . '' "

The walls of Xebar-70 shook like an earthquake in the sky . We zoomed past clawed fingers of lightning which tried to lash our ship 's boxed exterior .

 Doreen 's face was as dark as the sky when she turned back to her control panel . I 'd seen that look during negotiations with the Nurian republic . The same look she had when they declined to release our people . And it was still across her face when she said we would break them out . 
" The steering wheel vibrated in my hands as I pulled up toward the lightest patch of cloud I could find . `` Spinners x-30 , Mid-levellers north , boosters on thrust . We 're going to make it out of this *bitch ! * '' "
" It was a play on luck and experience . I 'd weathered a worse storm in Carvali , and even then I 'd had two boosters less and a much smaller ship . We could do this , I was sure of it . "
" Doreen tapped at various spots on the control panel . `` Mid-levellers are n't responding . Boosters online , Spinners x-30 . '' "
" The ship 's vibration stabilized slightly and we cruised on toward the cloud bed above . No Mid-levellers meant the ship would shake once we hit the cloud , and our passengers would get the worst of it . "
" Suddenly , purple blotches seeped through the sky . "
" `` Bloody shit . It 's a Storm beast , '' I hissed . "
" `` Okay , now we really have to go back , Dean . This is no longer a discussion . Turn - the - ship -around . Now ! '' "
" A storm beast was a bird of sorts . When I say of sorts , I mean it looks a lot like a pterodactyl that 's wide enough to span a storm . The thing carries so much static energy with it that it changes the colour of the sky purple . However , its focus would be on decimating the land below . I hoped . "
" I looked at Doreen and placed a hand on the thrust lever . She stared back with wide eyes . `` You ca n't , Dean . You 're going to kill us . Please , listen . '' "
" `` I would n't do this if I did n't have to , come on , Doreen . You know this is it . Are you with me or not ? '' "
" She stared at my hand and then placed her shaky palm on top and squeezed . I lifted my chin toward the heavens , prepared to clash with the beast above . "
" `` *Shit . Shit . Shit . * Please , God . . . '' Doreen whispered . "
" `` We 're going to make it through . I swear , '' I said . "
" We burst into the clump of purple cloud . My teeth chattered from the force tearing at the ship . Doreen squeezed my hand and pulled down on the thruster , accelerating . The screams of the refugees were muddled in with the groaning of metal . And then as we burst over the edge of the cloud , we saw it . "
" A silver bird , its body covered in blotches of purple . For a moment I almost mistook it for the sky itself . Its dark black pupils widened in surprise as we shot past . A small spec in a chasm of awesome power . "
" Stopping only when we were safe in outerspace . <newline>
It ’ d been hours . Roderick was ready to burst , and from the way his co-workers and the handful of folks unfortunate enough to be in the bank at the time wriggled , writhed , and complained , they were feeling the same . Thursday , of course it was Thursday . "
" Roderick brought some of his wife , Rosie ’ s , baked goods to the bank every Thursday . This Thursday was fritters . He ’ d just gotten the bright pink box open and was ready to share when , as one , every person in the bank turned for the bathroom . "
" Desperate , Roddy knew he wouldn ’ t make it , couldn ’ t make it . Got ta go so bad it hurt . Everyone in the room was doubled over . All but one . "
" Man in a wheelchair , had a grey suit and a white luchador mask , pink birds danced across the cheeks . Blush , he was known as . Popular online , humiliated a lot of famous folk , politicians , musicians , a couple actors , some journalists even . "
" That ’ d been before noon , and all afternoon they ’ d been trapped in the bank , waiting for that face-burning rush down the leg that just refused to arrive . Blush had demanded safe passage when the police arrived , talks and threats were exchanged . Stalemate . "
" Someone had to be coming . One of the good guys , the supers , the capes , as Roddy ’ s nephew called them . He just hoped they wore adult diapers . "
" There was a rustle above , a quiet thunk , and a curse . Someone was in the vents , but they were too small , even for most kids . Who the heck could be up there ? "
" Out erupted a grimy , fuzzy purple goat . The hostages coughed as years of pent-up yuck showered upon them . The goat stood on its hind legs , brushed itself off as best a stuffed animal could , and , as matter-of-fact as only a metre-tall purple goat can , asked , “ Okay folks , who wants outta here ? I brought diapers , sports drink , and sandwiches . Anyone vegan ? Or got allergies ? ” "
" <newline> Once he was certain the other hostages were safely locked in the break room , Blush made his way to the vault , the manager , Alison in tow . The woman squirmed and shuffled as uncomfortable as a dam on the verge of overflow , “ don ’ t worry , you ’ ll be just fine . So long as you co-operate , no one goes viral , ” he told her as they trekked downwards , “ I ’ m sure you know the drill , give me marked bills , those dye-splatter bits , or any other funny stuff and things can be a lot worse than they are now. ” "
" She filled the large knapsack he proffered , “ no , no dear , I want you to riffle through them , no funny business , remember ? ” "
" A slight look of concentration , and Alison grimaced , “ Okay , okay , sorry . Wasn ’ t- ” she winced again , “ thinking . Could you turn this down ? It hurts. ” "
" “ Sorry dear , harder to tell with women , ” the quiet chirp of a phone ’ s alert , “ ah , I ought check back in on your employees. ” "
" He fiddled with his phone a moment , swore , “ It appears we have company . That ’ ll be enough , Alison was it ? I ’ m going to have to lock you in , sorry , but that ’ s just how it is . Don ’ t worry , ” he gestured on his phone , “ the police already know you ’ re down here . Brace yourself , I can ’ t take any chances , you know , ” that slight frown again , and she crumpled as the door swung closed , “ it ’ ll pass , just breathe slowly. ” "

 `` Why those pants ? And on the new leather couch ! '' 
 `` They 're my comfy pants . '' 
 `` *They're* made of steaks ! '' 
 `` ... well yeah that 's what makes them comfy . '' 
" Her and I have had this talk before . I had always enjoyed her peculiar fashion sense , but had thought *wrongly* that it was limited to the stage and award shows . "
" `` Sweety , '' I said `` That does n't look comfy . It looks like you 've sat in the middle of someones misguided attempt to reconstruct a cow . '' "
" She pouted at me . I smiled back . She had a nice pout . We stared at eachother for a moment . Love 's a strange thing - stranger even than the way my wife dresses . She eventually smiled and , defeated , I took my place next to her on the couch , snuggled up and readied myself for a movie . "
 `` Oh ? '' She said `` what are your pant 's made of ? ''

Anna had a habit of kissing me on the forehead . "
" When my mother died I ’ d feel a tingle down my spine when she did it . It had only been weeks since we started dating and her soft lips felt taboo against the particular patch of skin she rested them upon . The loud smack of her lips would pull me out of that hospital room where my mom coughed up her cancer for the last time and planted me firmly in the moment , where everything was quiet and Anna ’ s hands would thumb away the tears that had no more reason to leak . I couldn ’ t help but perk my lips upward , voluntarily forgetting the pain that felt so far away , shy and vulnerable in those moments . Everything was okay . "
" It was years later and it was dark . There was a blackout in my neighborhood so I decided to leave my apartment and head over to Anna ’ s a couple blocks away to surprise her . The walk was longer and windier than usual . It broke me down , out of breath and weary . The wind whistled with increased violence as I stopped to catch my breath . I fought against it , indifferently and ignorantly and a million other adjectives apt to break me down foolish . "
" I climbed the stairs to where a pajamaed neighbor was standing outside her door . He looked mad with resent . Confusion left when I reached the door , and all sound was snuffed by a harrowing ring . I heard a glimpse of something , uncanny and out of place like a nightmare as my mind tried to rationalize it . I didn ’ t hear what the man said , but it sounded like he was yelling for them to shut up . Them . I held composure , trying to force a relatable nod and smirk towards the man as he rolled his eyes at me and slammed back into his door . The screams were a grenade to my nerves . Cognitive dissonance was short lived . My stomach emptied its insides into my knees , buckling them together and collapsing them under the weight . Pulsing , timely , thumps like some sickly metronome conducted her “ yes ’ s ” and “ oh yeah ’ s , ” and “ fuck me ’ s. ” Soon the whole apartment block seemed to leave their doors , some parents covering their sheepish children ’ s ears , talking amongst themselves in disgust . And they all stared at me , collapsed on top the face of her door , trying to pull back tears with my hands like scooping up air . I ended up banging them against the ground , as my mind bled into involuntary , broken moments . The ringing came again like an aftershock , attempting to immune me from the pain . Another neighbor walked towards the door set on saying something to me . I ran . "
" I ran back home . I turned to my kitchen knives and took the tallest , sharpest one out . I looked down at past scars , knife aimed down at them ready to split them open once again . I started to think about my mother , and the days before her death when she would pull my arm out of my sleeve and begin to cry . I started to think about Anna crying into them , madly kissing my forehead as her tears buckled against her lips and trickled down my arms , stinging them . "
 I started to think about Anna . 
 Anna . 
" I wanted to split them open . I wanted to split myself open and rip out all the invisible memories that ravaged me alone and insecure , malevolently hopeless . I wanted to rip something away from me . I wanted to rip away the past and start over . I wanted to rip something . "
 I woke up with my scars intact and knife in hand . I didn ’ t remember going to sleep . 
 There was a knock on my door . I opened it and it was Anna . 
 The unnoticed knife nodded in my trembled fingertips . 
" She looked bright and cheerful . Fresh with a bow , like a polished porcelain doll , pristine and lack of fingerprint . "
" She grabbed my cheek . Her fingers were rough against it as it was numb against her . Her half smile rang through my spine and paralyzed me with hesitation . I couldn ’ t hold back my lips as they turned upwards , trained like a dog . I dropped the knife , and its thud went unnoticed . "
" I started to think about my mother as she kissed me on the forehead . <newline>
It had happened again . I woke up in a blank white room with an almost faceless man , I mean he must have had a face , its just that I could n't make it out ... I do n't know why this felt so familiar . <newline> Before my mind could wonder , he began as he always did . "
 `` How do you feel right now ? '' 
 `` Fine '' I replied . By this point I knew there was no point in asking questions . He would ask his questions and then ... I do n't know what happened after that . I mean I vaguely remembered bits and pieces of ... 
 `` Do you know why you are here ? '' the interviewer interrupted my train of thought . 
" `` No ... wait ... I- I did something ... '' I struggled to remember why I was here , what I had done to get here , where here was even , but before I could make sense of it he began with his next question . "
 `` What does it mean to be a good person ? '' <newline> `` What does it mean to be a bad person ? '' <newline> `` Are you a good person or a bad person ? '' <newline> `` How can you be a better person ? '' 
" The interviewer rattled his questions off and I answered them as best I could . I had trouble following him most the time and I am sure my answers came out incoherent at best . It was this place ... My mind seemed ... almost in a daze as if waking up on an operating room table staring into the light . Nothing quite made sense , yet it seemed like it was as it should be . "
" At a point the questions stopped and it seemed he was lecturing me on kindness and caring . As the lecture continued my world became fuzzier , and I more disoriented . As I began to lose myself in a void of unconscious confusion the world seemed to disappear in a flash . "
 It had happened again . I woke up in a blank room with a faceless man . It felt so familiar ... 
" `` How do you feel right now ? ''
I woke up and stretched in my bed . Anther glorious day . I got up , adjusted myself , and walked off towards the kitchen to get breakfast . But everything out here was wrong . Someone had moved part of my house around . Where was I ? What happened ? Suddenly I felt a warm arm around my shoulders and a nice-looking woman with a kind voice asked if I wanted some breakfast . Of course I did . What else would I want at this time of day . "
" I glanced at the clock but the hands seemed off . I could n't quite make out whether the short hand was pointing at the 3 or I do n't know . I ignored it and walked on . I walked in , ready to order . I wanted , that one food , uhm , what was its name again ? They gave me a tray and it looked more like lunch food to me even though they were calling it dinner but whatever . When in Rome , right ? "
" I sat down and started eating and Darryn happened to come sit down by me . I smiled at him and reached over to pat him on the shoulder and he smiled back . We talked for a little while about the meal , and he told me that he had been promoted at work and I told him how happy I was for him . Then he got up to leave and I said goodbye to him and he looked a little puzzled . "
" `` I 'm your son , '' he said , `` Andres . My father Darryn died ten years ago . '' I immediately felt a great feeling of shame and sadness come over me . It was so terrible that Darryn had lost his job and I said as much to him , that I was so sorry he 'd just lost his job but that we could get through it . Darryn looked sad too but I knew things would get better eventually . He 'd find another job . He gave me a hug before he turned to go . "
" Then I went back to my room , although I got a little lost on the way . I did see a group of three women with kind voices though , so I went to ask them . `` I 'm a little lost , '' I said . `` Can you help me find my room ? '' "
" A man walked up and the women waved him over , `` She 's lost , '' they said . "
" He smiled broadly and looked at me . `` Hi , Lost , my name is Bart . '' "
" I smiled back at him . His voice was so nice . `` I 'm lost , do you know where my room is ? '' "
" His smile faltered and he looked at the women near him . `` I , '' he started then he coughed and cleared his throat . "

Where am I ? How did I get here ? What is going on ? Why is there so much blood in the room ? "
" I must keep quiet . I have clearly been attacked . I dont know where my attacker is , but I must get out of here before he returns . "
 I open the door to the room I am in and look around . I see a small room behind a one way mirror . There is a guy on the floor curled up in a ball . He has been beaten badly . Someone very sadistic did this to him . 
" I open his door , and he screams at me to leave . I tell him I will be back for him and he starts crying . Clearly he is mentally unstable . I walk over to him and put my arm on him and tell him he will be alright . I must have touched a broken bone or something , because he jumped at my touch and started screaming more . "
 Do n't worry . I promise I will come back for you . I told him . 
 I shut the door behind him . 
 I go up some stairs and open a door . The door on the other side is impossible to see without knowing where the latch is to open it . I feel around and ifnd out how to open the door from the other side if I have to . 
" I quietly shut the door , and peek into the living room from the office I am now in . The TV is on and a Lady is sitting in front of it , and I hear noise upstairs . "
" Oh my God . The lady is a serial killer . I have to get out of here . I can see the door drom here , but it has 4 locks on it and I do n't think I can quietly escape . I pick up a weighted bookend and slowly creep towards the door to see if I can maybe get outside ithout her realizing it . "
" As I am sliding the last lock , I hear a loud voice behind me say , just where do you think you are going ? In a panic , I turn around and hit her over the head with the bookend . I did n't kow what to do so I kept pounding her head with it until she stopped convulsing . "
" While I am glad she got what she deserved , I am repulsed by what I have done . What kind of human could kill someone and enjoy it . I quickly dial 911 and run outside the house and down the road , waiting for the cops to arrive . I tell them about the man in the basement . I see him getting loaded into the ambulance , while the cops are tlaking to me . He starts screaming at me when he sees me . "
 He says `` That is the guy that did this to me '' All of a sudden the cops have me on the ground . I tell the cops that the guy is delirious . The first time I ever saw him was when I was escaping from my prison next to his . They keep me cuffed for a long time . Eventually a cop comes out and arrests me . 
" While I might never fully know what happened , here is what the police used to convict me of murder : "
" 1 . My fingerprints were all over the house . <newline> 2 . I was married to the lady I killed . <newline> 3 . The noise upstairs were my children playing . <newline> 4 . I had a costant videotape of my office , and I was the only one to ever go in the room , and I went all the time . <newline> 5 . I took people down to the hidden basement almost weekly . <newline> 6 . They discovered 47 bodies in a different room in the basement . "
" Because of my mental state , they have me in a hospital for life they said . "
 I must have been set up . I know it could not have been me . They must have doctored the evidence to frame me . 
" After all if the governement could cover up 9-11 so easily , taking me down must have been easy by comparison . "
" So I sit and try and figure out why they erased my memory . I had a job as a stock broker . I read the newspaper every day , and I think I have finally figured it out . "
" I have looked over every stock , and I now know the pattern . I must have discovered it before , and the government did n't want me getting rich off of it . "
" I keep explaining this to my doctors , but each one assures me I am insane , but I notice my doctors keep getting richer very fast then disappear after a couple of weeks . "
" I have to warn someone , but the only guy here that believes me says his name is John Nash ... ... ... ... ... .
I kicked in the door , turned on the flash light and saw it sitting there among the old shelves long empty , an old copy of the bible , the leather was cracked and the pages torn but it was real a bible I could fork my fingers threw . It was unlike other books I had bought and sold it was written all over almost every page was filled with notes and reflections on the gospels I 'd seen books like this go at the underground auctions millions of units billions if I could find the right buyer I could be set for life but I could see the value in this book . This is n't just a book this is a piece of art I will not sell this .

The telescope was patterned with verdigris and fingerprints , but the brass was still bright . <newline> It had belonged to Robin 's grandfather and her grandmother had set it up for her on the rural porch , preparing for the orbiting object . The young girl had done the mathematics herself , figuring out where in the sky the satellite would fly by and helping her grandmother 's spidery , blue-veined hands to get the old instrument at the correct azimuth . <newline> `` I polished the lens , '' the old woman said as she gazed up into the clear night sky , `` you can see Sirius clear as day . '' <newline> Robin nodded and flipped though her notes , her auburn eyebrows drawn together in worry . <newline> `` I hope I got this right . '' <newline> Her grandfather 's pocket watch sat nearby , ticking resolutely . They had another ten minutes before it was due to breach the horizon . <newline> The old woman draped a shawl around her granddaughter 's shoulders ; it was cold and the girl had n't dressed warmly - she was flushed with excitement and the heady thrill of adventure . <newline> *Is this a mistake ? * <newline> The thought came unbidden to the grandmother 's mind . Was she a fool to encourage activities like this ? Her own mother - were she still alive - would be sniping at her about encouraging girls to be dreamers , not homemakers . <newline> But the old woman remembered her own dreams at Robin 's age - selfish dreams of inventing electric devices , of making circuits of copper and batteries , exploring the seemingly unlimited potential of the new age of electricity . <newline> `` Grandma , '' the girl began , `` do you think they 'll ever put a man in space ? '' <newline> The matriarch gave a frail smile , <newline> `` I do n't doubt it child ; it is only a matter of time and money I 'd say . '' <newline> Robin pursed her lips , wondering if she should ask the next question . <newline> Detecting the reluctance of her granddaughter , she wrapped her thin arms around the child 's shawl-draped shoulders in reassurance . <newline> `` Grandma , '' Robin licked her lips , <newline> `` Yes little one ? '' <newline> `` Do you ... do you think they 'll ever put a *woman* in space ? '' <newline> Even though she 'd known the question was coming , the old woman known as Jolene sucked in a sudden breath , a curious *pang* touching her heart . <newline> `` I do n't know , '' she admitted with bald-faced honesty - the kind she did n't normally use around children . <newline> They sat in silence for the remaining four minutes , watching the hands of the pocket watch tick around the mother-of-pearl face . <newline> As the moment arrived , the girl pressed her eye to the telescope and watched intently . <newline> For a few precious seconds , she saw a dim , moving light rise through the lens - then it was gone from her view . <newline> With a whoop of joy she leaped up from the wicker chair and hugged her grandmother around the middle , <newline> `` I *saw it* Grandma ! I saw *Sputnik ! * '' <newline> Holding her granddaughter close , the old woman smiled . The girl had calculated everything correctly ; her mathematical precision was uncanny for a nine-year-old . <newline> `` Come inside Robin , '' she said , `` your hands are frozen . '' <newline> Leaving her dead husband 's telescope on the porch , she took the child 's hand and led her back inside . <newline>
`` Wire me to any patrol bots near the crime scene . '' I said , as i prepare to connect to investigate a case of murder . Not any ordinary murder , but one of the famous Oscar winning actor , Sebastion Jones . "
" `` Detective Alex Burton , LAPD . '' I said to the officer at the scene . After being let into the crime scene , I immediately look for any evidence . I immediately spot a puddle of oil on the ground , confirming my deepest worries . A robot did this . I sighed , this is going to be one hell of a case . "
" After thanking the officers at the crime scene , I disconnected from the patrol bot . In order to gather more evidence , i will have to head down to the crime scene myself . "
" This murder was unlike any others . The scene was clean . I 've been on the force for 31 years to see multiple thousands of murder cases , this is the cleanest murder yet . There were no traces , no fingerprints , no murder weapon and no motive of murder to be found anywhere at the crime scene . This was a professional job . Someone who had done this before . "
" `` Sir , we found something '' , a young officer with holding a transparent plastic bag said as he approached me . The bag seems to have some opaque brown liquid in it . `` Whats this ? '' I asked . `` Type 18 Oil '' , he replied . `` And how is this evidence ? '' I asked , puzzled . Ever since the introduction of Human-Controlled Robots ( HCRs ) six years ago , my life and job started to become literal hell as more and more people learnt to control robots . As a senior person , i 'm not fond with technology . `` You see sir , the robots working here are all Model H robots , which uses Type 16 Oil , and not Type 18 Oil , which was only used by the model X robots. '' . Amazed at the newfound evidence . I commended the young officer . Indeed , this was the big break that we needed . I surveyed the surveillance footage once more , and indeed , a model X robot had gone through this corridor . "
" I turnt to the police officers who were busily discussing their own theories . `` Boys , we 've found the bot , now lets find the man '' . Feeling confident and at the same time partially worried , i headed off back to the station . Only god will know where this case might take us . After all , this was a professional job . "

A friend of mine said it was something like a mushroom trip or a lucid dream , and you had to skip a night of sleep for it to work . I had skipped the night of sleep like they said I needed to , truth be told , I had skipped two nights . With the help of Starbucks I was still up . We drove up to his dad 's cabin . They were cheering and pushing me up towards the door . My friend came in the cabin with me , where it was pitch black , save for two candles . The walls were draped with black felt , so it felt like we stood in the black of space . Up above the candles there was a large mirror , and beneath it , closer to us , was a recliner . Here it was quiet , here it was warm , here was another place . "
" I took my place in the recliner , my friend sat somewhere unseen behind me . He told me to stare into the mirror and instructed me to keep speaking , and not to stop . It started out pretty innocuous , the candles were very dim , even for candles , so i could n't see anything in the mirror , except for the candle 's reflection in my own eyes , tiny glittering lights dancing in the dark . I mentioned that , how profoundly comfortable the chair was , and how I could hear his pencil on the paper . Focusing on the tiny twin glints of light in the mirror , my voice became more distant , as if far away in a tunnel , the sound of my friend 's writing was not noticeable , and even the chair felt like it had fallen away , and I was floating in the black nothingness of space . Even the aches of sleep deprivation had evaporated somewhere else . The universe consisted of me , the darkness , and the light , they were singular now . "
 -- - 
" The light , it was the light , the light people always talk about . The light was the light at the end of the tunnel , the proverbial light for the dead . It took what felt like hours , but it was much nearer now , nearly engulfing me . My grandmother was here , her warm smile , now years vacant from my life . Its warmth filled me with relief and contentment I had not known for too long . Her son , my uncle , was there too . Everyone gone was there , and they welcomed me warmly , and with love . as I approached , they walked backwards , beckoning me into the light . Clouds rolled at their feet , I walked on a path of golden light cut through it . I approached and they retreated towards the light , facing me . "
" When There was only enough darkness left to see them , I was finally able to draw near them . I was able to hug my grandma . She was exactly as I remembered her . I was relaxation , I was contentment . In this moment of bliss I felt her pull at me with all her strength , suddenly , and with vigor , she pushed herself away from me , I remained motionless , she could not move me . I was confused . The warmth in her eyes was gone , I was about to say something when my uncle grabbed my wrist and pulled as hard as he seemed able to . Again I did n't budge , my arm did n't even move . The departed relatives looked at each other with bafflement , I grabbed my uncle 's wrist and pulled him to the golden path , the ray of light I walked on . From the bottom of his legs protruded not feet , but trunks , extending downwards , then back , back into the light . I felt my uncle 's wrist crumple like an empty canvas bag or a glove , his image shot up off the image in front of me to reveal a mess of glowing golden roots entwined around splinters of what was once a skeleton , all of them pouring into the skull . through the eyes , through the mouth , through the nose . they shook themselves free of all the bones but the skull , and the Skull , now the terminus of a trunk reading out from the light wrapped around me and pulled with what I could only describe as the strength of a god . Still , I did not budge . "
" My friend was bent over me shining a light in my face . I was covered in water and the lights were on . `` That was important work champ , we know where to find them now '' He stuck a needle in my neck , Next time I woke I found myself at home in my bed . None of my other friends ever saw him again , and when we went out to see where the cabin was , it had burnt down . I was , however , able to find some shards of a broken mirror , and two candle holders amongst the ash .
`` Send orders for Sir Thompson to advance , General . '' "
" The King 's highest ranking officer bowed deferentially , and turned to pass the order down the chain of command . "
" `` Wait , General . '' "
" General Stewart stopped in his tracks , and turned back to face his King . "
" `` Yes , your Highness ? '' "
" `` If we have to do this 'Battle ' malarkey , we do it the British way , or not at all . It 's the other chap 's turn right now , what what ? '' "
 Stewart betrayed his thoughts with a blank look of confusion . 
" `` I ... I 'm not sure I follow , your Highness . '' "
" `` And here I was thinking you were a sporting fellow , Stewart ! Poor show , poor show . Did n't you just see me order Bishop Allen to the attack ? It 's only right and proper that the gentleman opposite issues an order next . '' "
" General Stewart considered debating the point , but soon thought better of the idea . `` As you will , your Highness . I will await the roundhead 's next maneuvers . '' "
" The King looked quite proudly , and not a little smugly , down at the man . "
" `` Oh , and one more thing , Stewart . '' "
 `` Your Highness ? '' 
" `` When you send Sir Thompson his orders , could you ... could you tell him to just move ... ooh , I do n't know . Just move a little bit to the left once he 's in place ? Just to be proper , of course . '' "
" The General sighed . What with the debacle involving a person instructed to wear a miniature castle in the last battle , and now this , the Royalist 's hopes in this accursed civil war were looking slim . <newline>
Once upon a time , in a world quite similar to our own , a middle aged divorcee sat at her table in her tiny , dimly lit kitchen . Dishes were stacked in the sink , the floor was in desperate need of a mop but at least her two noisy boys were finally asleep . "
" She looked out the window of her apartment . Tonight looked and sounded like any night in the city , sirens music , traffic blended into a discordant symphony of sorts . But it felt ... magical somehow . She sighed , it had been a hard 3 months but things had to get better right ? She sat at her table and stared at the box of bills right in front of her . <newline> She sighed and reached for the bill right at the top . But before she touched it an itch from the depths of hell developed from her rear end . She had no choice but to give it a good scratching . So she closed her eyes and really gave herself the satisfaction she needed . "
" When she opened her eyes , a shimmering image of a younger more beautiful version of her in a sultry red dress was standing right in the middle of the table . Staring at her . She grabbed a large knife from the counter that was so close to her in her hobbit kitchen and shouted , `` What the F ... <newline> `` Now would you really like to kill someone who looks like you ? '' the image asked . "
" The woman hesitated and that ’ s all it took . The image touched her , and just like that she knew this image was her genie . The woman had the genie gene . The itch she felt was a magical itch triggered by the magic in the air . When she scratched that particular spot on her rear end , the genie had appeared . "
" The woman was suddenly calm . `` So do I make a wish or something ? '' she asked . <newline> `` No ! Of course not , I just help you out with three things that are making your life difficult right now . '' <newline> `` Okay , so I want my husband ba.. '' <newline> `` I do n't perform miracles honey , just a bit of magic . Okay , your rent and bills are paid , your kids will be more considerate and you wo n't be needing a plumber anymore '' . "
" <newline> In a poof and a swirl , the genie was gone , and for about a month the woman was content . <newline>
“ I am bound to this rock , unable to leave . But I still have more freedom than you. ” "
 Warden Sanjeev regarded the prisoner with bemusement . “ That ’ s it ? That ’ s all he says ? ” 
" The guard bobbed his helmeted head in a brief affirmative . Sanjeev couldn ’ t see the man ’ s face behind the opaque , black visor , but his tense posture told Sanjeev that he bought into the superstition surrounding the prisoner . "
" Sanjeev barked a short laugh . “ Bit of a disappointment , isn ’ t it ? ” "
" He crouched down to view the prisoner at eye-level . The man was unwashed , unshaven , and truth be told , probably undernourished , even by the prison island ’ s standards . The guards likely withheld rations from the man . Whether that was due to fear of the prisoner ’ s supposed influence on those around him , or anger stemming from the rumors regarding his role in the previous Wardens ’ demise , Sanjeev was unsure . "
" Looking at him now , however , Sanjeev was sure that the man posed no threat . "
" Warden Rogers , his predecessor , had been hiding a long battle with mental health . It was no surprise that 6 months of running Boyle Island had persuaded him to throw himself onto the jagged peaks surrounding much of the island ’ s cliff face . His obsession with the prisoner had little to do with that . "
" The Warden before Rogers – Sanjeev couldn ’ t recall his name – was nearly eighty years old by the time they shipped him back to the mainland one of the island ’ s helicopters , the lone source of arrival and departure from the island . The man had been mumbling phrases like , “ I can leave , ” and “ Is this freedom ? ” It ’ s likely the rumors started there , the guards being unable to accept that their old boss had finally turned senile . "
" Sanjeev pushed a greasy lock of hair off of the prisoner ’ s face . The man ’ s eyes held a startling – anger ? No , misguided determination , perhaps , Sanjeev mused . He put that thought aside for later consideration . "
" “ You ’ re damn right , son , ” Sanjeev conceded . “ You are bound to this rock . My rock . I ’ m the new Warden here , so I own this rock now , and that means I own you. ” Sanjeev grinned . “ Now , if that ’ s your idea of freedom , that ’ s quite alright to me . Long as you sit there , nice and quiet-like , and don ’ t cause no trouble , then we can get along just fine . I might even let you off those wall shackles . I bet your wrists are just aching ” – Sanjeev drew out the word for emphasis – “ for their own freedom. ” "
" Sanjeev paused . The prisoner said nothing , though his gaze was unwavering . "
" “ Mr . Cortez , I am familiar with your transgressions . You tried to assassinate the Executive General of our nation-state . Such things are not easily forgiven. ” Sanjeev observed the prisoner for any reaction to this , but none was forthcoming . "
" “ But , ” he continued , “ those that are residing in my prison , and are not challenging the authority or integrity of those in my employ , are working towards catharsis . I respect that , and I am willing to treat you as a new soul , fresh to the world of civilized beings and capable of making rational decisions . In return , you must agree to follow the rules that I have , and will continue to , set forth for this prison. ” "
 The Warden allowed Cortez to consider this for a moment . 
 “ Do we have an agreement ? ” he asked solemnly . 
" Sound of clanging filled the cell as the other prisoners were released for lunch . Footsteps of guards clacked down the concrete hallway as they left their cell posts to monitor the eating area . Soon , the only ones remaining in the block were Sanjeev , the two guards accompanying him , and Cortez . "
" The silence of the block became palpable , and Sanjeev became acutely aware of his guards ’ fidgeting behind him . Sanjeev frowned inwardly . He would need to address that lack of resolve soon . He added it to his mental to-do list . "
" “ Very well , ” Sanjeev began , standing and turning to leave the cell . “ I ’ ll give you some time to think on— “ "
" “ I am bound to this rock , unable to leave . But I still have more freedom than you. ” "
" Sanjeev stopped in the opening of the cell door , framed by the bars and his two guards . He sighed . Without looking back , he ordered the guards , “ Unshackle him. ” "
" They moved to do so . “ Then beat him until your arms are tired . Move him to solitary afterward . And make sure you take the scenic route , let him see the lunch room one last time . It might be a while before he makes it back. ” "
" The guards hesitated . Sanjeev turned . “ I gave you those batons for a reason , and you will use them
I am alone . The silence is empowering . Nothing to hear . Nobody to talk to . I can finally be alone with my thoughts . Eternity is mine , and mine alone , and in it , I am whole . I am free . Someone tried to take my eternity from me . A man . He liked to talk . He did n't want to be alone . He would talk for hours , stealing my time from me . He said such strange things . He wanted to bring back humanity . He tried to force me to help him . I hit him in the head with a rock . The man finally stopped talking . And now I am alone again .
The world was divided into three sorts of people . The castle folks who lived a comfortable life in the sky . The Valiant , who either had flying contraptions or tamed dragons , and lived in the valley or the castle . And the people beyond the valley . The valley was protected by the Valiant . The dragons were usually enough to keep the outsiders out , but there were some outsiders who were braver , or curious about what was beyond the mountains , or why there were always clouds coming out of the valley . Policy about what to do with the intruders varied from generation to generation , ranging from `` kill on sight , '' `` test their worthiness , '' to `` offer them trade deals , '' depending on the how life in the valley was . "
" Currently , the policy dictated that the intruders be administered a test or other challenge , of which there was an approved list of options for the intruders to choose from . If they passed , they would be presented the option of either permanently relocating into the world inside the valley ( they would be permitted to bring their families ) , or entering a trade partnership with the people of the valley , but never being able to see the valley themselves . If they failed , they would be administered a memory-befuddling drug and sleeping drought , and then safely returned to the outside world . Repeat offenders would be blindfolded and brought to trial in the castle . "
" Despite being the safest city in the world , the princess was still heavily guarded within the castle , and was rarely allowed to wander the streets of the castle town . Occasionally she would be able to arrange a Valiant escort down to the valley floor to swim in the crystal clear river . Still , she longed for freedom . She had been known on multiple occasions to have attempted to trade places with her servants , sneaking out to the castle town , but was always found quickly . Her new plan was even bolder and more daring though . "
" One day , on one of her trips to the valley floor , she drugged all but one of her Valiant escorts into a deep sleep that would last for more than a few hours , ensuring she would have sufficient time to convince the last guard , a trainee only slightly older than her , to show her the rest of the world . "
" “ I wish to see the world outside the valley , ” she said , point blank , to the last remaining guard . "
 He looked around at his sleeping comrades . “ What have you done ? ” 
" “ I thought you might be the easiest to talk into showing me , ” she said , in a bit of a singsong voice . “ You have a dragon . You ’ re only a little older than I am. ” "
 “ Do you know why you always ride the contraptions ? ” he asked her . 
" “ Seats are easier to add to the contraptions than to a dragon ’ s saddle , ” she replied . "
" “ True , but there is another reason . It ’ s one your father tried to keep hidden from you , because your mother died when you were young , leaving you as sole heir to the throne. ” "
" “ I know he wants to keep me safe and unscratched , so I can be queen when he croaks. ” She was getting impatient , and curious . “ He has a long line of suitors from around the castle lined up to court me . Tell me something I don ’ t know. ” "
" “ Your mother was Valiant . A dragon-riding Valiant . You mustn ’ t tell anyone I told you this . Your father would have me killed . But if you ride a dragon , you will establish a link with it . Such links are not easily broken . It ’ s part of your blood , a legacy your mother left you , and which will be passed down for a few generations further . The trait is renewed , ensured to pass to the next generation , by bonding with a dragon. ” "
 The news was a shock . It took her a moment to process it . “ I still want to see the land outside the valley. ” 
" “ Having two Valiant bonded with a dragon isn ’ t wise , ” the guard said . “ Not only does it create a mental link between the dragon and riders , but between the two riders. ” "
" “ Then find me a dragon , ” she demanded . “ I ’ ve seen you flying in groups and formations. ” "
" “ You don ’ t just find a dragon. ” The guard was starting to both be angry with the princess and admire her determination and fire . “ Until bonded , they are incredibly secretive , and will return to that secrecy to nest. ” "
" Nobody had spent more time watching the valley floor than the princess , who , while trapped in the castle , did have some license to explore the secured confines of the innermost circle of the city , the royal circle , and had spent a fair amount of time in the upper parapets , staring out the windows . During that time , she had seen her fair share of dragons , both with Valiant riders and without . And the ones without always vanished into
I sat down and let the chair absorb my full weight , a feeling I knew meant I was out for the count , and took out a cigarette . The air felt nice , though . Why did I have to mix whiskey and ... `` Alex ? '' The person sitting across called my name , unsure if she got it right . I smiled in assurance that she did . She sort of looks like Jessica in this light . "
" `` Are you feeling okay ? '' I asked . I saw that drink change his demeanor from jumpy to ready for bed . The party just started , there were still people coming . `` Yeah , thanks , I 'll be okay in a minute , '' he laughed . He 's cute . "
" `` Hey , '' I nudged my friend , `` think she 's taken ? '' and jerked my eyes to the direction of the girl that was talking just talking . Joey turned his neck to me , then to her , then back to his cigarette . "
" `` Who cares man , not like she 'll care if you talk to her . '' `` You got a point . '' `` Joey , you got a lighter ? '' I patted my pockets looking for my missing lighter . "
" `` I have it , my bad . '' I went over to light Alex 's cigarette and handed it back to Joey . `` It 's chilly . '' I let out a pop and the permeating smell brought Andy and his friend over to the table . "
" Do n't do it Alex . Do n't take a hit . You 're already fucked up , look I 'm giving myself directions . Just pass it along , there you go . I looked into the house from the balcony and saw some new people coming in . `` Fuck . '' "
" I opened the front door and to my happy surprise I saw Rachel . `` Jessica ! ! '' I gave her a big hug , and in a hushed tone she let me know Alex was here . I looked around and saw him looking my way . "

We saw their ship as it rounded Jupiter . The movies were right , the way to tell a space ship was that it was slowing down as it approached . "
" The earth went mad . There were celebrations and mourning . Countries furiously debated whether we were meant harm or not , and planned for each contingency . We debated nukes and the effect of atmospheric detonation - would we be better off to launch now and save us the fallout ? "
 Eventually we started receiving radio messages . The fact that they sent radio instead of something more advanced spurned on more debates . We knew they were authentic but it just seemed a bit ... primitive . Surely there was some better way of contacting us that was faster ? 
" We decoded their messages , and they ours . We taught our language and they theirs in the journey to our dusty ball . "
" The big day arrived at last . At the Canterbury plains we had built a landing site large enough to accommodate them . They landed with little fanfare , their rockets scorching the earth and lighting fires in all directions . "
" Turned out they were similar to us . Bipedal . Four limbs . Walk on two . Two eyes , one head . Spoke through sound and not telepathy . Did n't warble . No jelly like bodies . It was disappointing really . "
" But that was n't the largest disappointment . The reason they came was our entertainment . Turns out that they lived on the cusp of our transmission signals , and they wanted more . They wanted to find out what the aliens died from in war of the worlds . They wondered about Oz , and if Dorothy would make it back there . As they got closer to earth they wanted to know about Fonzi , and if he became successful . "
" We got some technology out of them , like faster space travel and better cleaner energy sources , but the people that knew how they worked died long ago , replaced by the couch potato people that came from the sky .
Ever get to some part of your life that 's taken you goddamn years , *decades* , and then just- poof , gone , `` Fuuuuuuck you ! `` , God throws a switch and kicks you off the stairs and into a ditch ?

" My brother was about to propose to his wife , one knee and diamond ring and all , when it happened . She 'd fallen to her knees with him , and begged forgiveness for a secret so long withheld . Her twist was that she 'd been a man ; his was that he , an unusually homophobic and hateful man , still wanted to marry her . Kind of funny , that one , actually . Bit inspiring . "
" My parents was riding a Greyhound from Chi-Town to Florida , though ; forty-one people on board , all quiet . Just about everybody sleeping in the early morning stretch through Tennessee . Somebody was a little fidgety , though , and , *surprise ! * there goes the driver with a box cutter . The madman throws the wheel into oncoming traffic and rolls her . Dad and seven others did n't make it ; mom 's okay , though . She 's remarried , living with the gentlest damn soul I 've ever seen . "
" The one I ca n't get over , that apparently *no one* can get over , was my own . I share it with a few thousand , actually . I was on the phone with my wife , asking her how she was doing at work- *boring as hell , as usual* -when it came through . I did n't hear it on my end , like everyone else did , being in a thick-ass studio , but I heard it through the phone . `` PLOT TWIST , '' like some demon was bellowing from the pit of hell . It could n't have been God booming down from the sky- God does n't fuck people up like that . "
" One of my clients snapped a string and cut up his tendons or nerves or something in his fingertips ; could n't play ever again , I heard . Poor bastard . I told my wife with a little bit of a shaky laugh that I 'd definitely gotten my plot twist . She laughed , too , telling me they 'd just had a bit of a shake . "
 Then she told me it was getting *really* jumpy over there . Then the line cut out .

 I liked it here . It was ... calm . So different from ... other places .

" And then I woke up . A strong wind was whitening the ocean , and lifting droplets of salt water that constantly hit my face . The once blue sky was dark grey , and suffocatingly low . "
 This could mean only one thing : the Beast was coming . The creature I dreaded the most had awoken from its slumber . I had to find shelter . 
" The wind so strong that the boat had been brought on the beach , I started walking toward the shack . But it was too late . "
" A terrible voice called my name , so loud it overcame the wind . `` STHEPEN MACLAKIN ! You had a duty ! You had sworn to carry it out ! '' "
" Terrified , I started running towards the building , my heart racing and pounding , under the pouring rain . As soon as I opened the door , a gush of wind slammed it shut . "
" The voice continued , shattering the skies : `` I told you to DO THE DISHES ! '' said the Beast , with voice of thunder . "
" `` But MOOOOM . I do n't wan na ! Five more minutes , PLEEEAAASEEEEE ! '' I implored , hopeful . But no , the island started melting away , and the reality of the projecting room filled the empty skies and the clear ocean . `` Do it NOW '' she screamed , from the door now ajar . "

He 's such a dick sometimes . Being on-call for that guy is a 24/7 duty . One time I was on a date and he did the same thing when I was in the bathroom . I was guaranteed to score . When I came out of the bathroom , I tried to keep a smile on my face . But that 's what I get . These looks did n't come cheap . The dude has an ironic aura to everything he does . "
" So after his distasteful drop-in , I couldnt help but give a sarcastic sigh . Effectively starting my shift until he says `` no mas , '' I could only wonder what the red man wanted this time . Would I have to scare kids by hiding under their beds ? Possess some poor sucker in front of his family ? Make a shmuck like me shit his pants on a date as some sort of reminder of how often it happens to me ? I really had no idea . "
" Being a demon sounds cool on paper , and all you have to do is the occasional `` bidding , '' but at least give me a task with just a little bit of substance . Or at least let me pick my own hours . This shit is tiresome . Nobody learns about or fears you since they do n't even know you exist . And the things you 're asked to do are n't exactly of biblical proportions . That whole getting YOLO to become the viral shit storm it is was my idea the entire time , but no , he needed the credit .

" So as I sat there , struggling to get the energy to get out of bed , I gave the ceiling one last hard glance , shook my head , and swung my legs out of bed . As I made my way to the bathroom through a giant pile of dirty clothes on the floor , I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror . And damn , did I look good .
I do n't get too much feedback either , but it 's not always about feedback . Sometimes knowing you 've written something good is a nice feeling . If you want more people to see it , you can submit your story as a [ PI ] ( prompt inspired ) and title it after the prompt you were writing about . That way you can get feedback . "
" I browse new a lot for new prompts , see if there 's anything I like . A lot of prompts I love but do n't write about because I do n't know enough about the subject or I feel like it 'd be too long . "
" Usually the stories are short enough that I submit them while others are still submitting their own stories , so it 's still active enough that people see them . But sometimes it 's too late , but that 's OK , because I wrote something , and that makes me proud of myself .
`` Hello , '' asked the woman , `` how much does this cost ? I could n't find a marked price . '' `` You wo n't , '' I replied , not looking up from my book , `` not on that , or anything else in this shop , save the cheap trinkets on that rack near the door . Now , lets have a look at what you 've found . '' I turned to face her . She was holding a small statue of a demon that was more horns and spikes than bare skin . I returned my attention to my book and said , `` You could n't afford that . '' `` How can you tell ? I 'll have you know I am a very wealthy woman , and I came in here looking for a souvenir for nephew back home , who seems terribly interested with this sort of thing . Otherwise , I 'd never have entered this tacky shop , '' came her indignant response . I kept my gaze locked on the book , and said , `` If you want something for your nephew , go to the trinket rack . That is not the sort of thing he would want , or that he should be having . I do n't care how much you have anymore ; even if it was enough , I would n't sell that to you now knowing that you plan on giving it to a child . '' `` How DARE you accuse me of being an irresponsible aunt ! '' she screamed . `` Its not an accusation , its the truth . I can see it . That 's not the issue here . The issue is that you have no idea what it is you are holding , or what it symbolizes , '' I said , still calm in the face of her fury . It was an odd contrast . `` Go to hell , '' was all she had to say . Thankfully , I had a comeback for that : `` I ca n't . Satan still has a restraining order against me . '' She made a disgruntled sound , threw the pointy statue at me , and left , making a futile attempt at slamming the two-way door on her way out . I caught the figurine without looking up . No damage was done to the figurine . The same could not be said for my hand , which now sported some nasty punctures and scrapes from the thorny demon .

" I run an occult shop in New Orleans . The difference between me and most places is that my items are the real deal . People who are in the know have a way of finding my place , while the myriad other shops keep the uninitiated out . Hiding in plain sight is a time-honored tactic for a reason . "
" The young lady in the back breathed a sigh of relief at the other woman 's departure . She had been carefully inspecting a mangled pickaxe that had been crushed in a coal mine cave-in resulting from poor management and safety standards , along with its owner . `` That happen a lot ? '' She asked . `` Not really . Most people who do n't know the truth about this shop just buy a cheap keepsake from the wall or take their business elsewhere . You clearly have taste , though . Implement of death and vengeance , that . Interested ? '' She came back with a question of her own : `` What you said , about Satan having a restraining order out on you , was that true ? '' I sighed , and nodded . I had hoped she would n't bring that up . `` Then that would make you The Grifter ! '' she exclaimed . I nodded again . "
" `` The Grifter . '' The name was a badge of honor and a mark of shame at the same time . I 'm one of an obscure category of people known as the Traders . We bargain with higher powers , cosmic entities , and other such beings as a way of life . Most of us do n't have souls . That is always the first thing to go . For us , a soul is a nest-egg , a place to start from . Turns out you do n't really need one . Lucky thing too . Because true names are even more valuable than souls , we all go by pseudonyms of some kind , and sooner or later we acquire a title . The young lady had sorted out mine . I got it after gaining a reputation for making less than fair trades . Not many people can con demons , angels , and eldritch horrors , and nobody as well as I could . Eventually , Satan got so frustrated with me that he permanently barred me from Hell . "
" The young lady continued , `` So , are the legends real then ? Did you really sell the rights to your soul after you died to three different entities ? Did you really bargain with Death himself for save haven from all three ? Did you- '' `` Look , '' I cut her off , `` If you want to ask me about this , we should do it in private . Go to the back room , I 'll close up shop . '' "

I read a book one time , or was told to in class and just bullshitted the assignments instead , I ca n't remember , but anyway in this book a special thing gets dropped on accident into the ocean and it turns it all into ice . I just made the very same mistake , only I myself am that special thing and the ocean is the whole continent of Australia , and instead of turning it into ice I turned the whole freaking thing into a surface that you can eat off of . Sterile as my great-uncle Joe , who 's 80 or near-abouts . What will this do to the country I fancy , you ask ? Oh , you know , just wreck its entire ecosystem and make decomposition a thing of the past . "

Maybe I would have lived a little longer . Another hour or day or week . Do I want to live another hour or day or week though ? I 've been degraded , strung up against a wall naked .

" I hear his boots on the ground , thundering . My weak legs give way , and I fall to the ground . I can feel the dried blood on my legs , and the fresh blood slowly dripping down from the new wounds he 's put on me . What is the point in trying to fight anymore ? I 'm just a little prey animal and he is the predator . He 's hunted me down , and now he 's just toying with me . The little shard of glass in my hand scrapes against the concrete as I bring it up to my throat . "

**Thump Thump** <newline> *Alright Eradicus , the friendly party will come through in about 10 minutes , the mid bosses already phoned in saying they were about to fight so its all up to you now , you can do this* . The 112 foot demon sighed to itself , and went back to rubbing its hands . It was n't for warmth , as Eradicus had balefire powerful enough to melt the earth itself and evaporate whole rivers in the blink of an eye , it was instead a nervous habit . <newline> **Thump Thump** <newline> *Alright , I 'll just activate the keystone runes that activate my hellguards and I should be fine , they got buffed recently meaning their armor is better , this time will be alright , it 'll be okay* . Eradicus almost started hyper ventilating before mentally stopping himself , flicking on the runes for the hellguards and the lava pits and ghost effigies . <newline> **Thump Thump** <newline> Eradicus looked down , casting his horrifying 4 eyed visage downwards to what appeared to be a naked boy . Eradicus tilted his head , bemused . `` Ca- Can you please stop that ? '' Eradicus asked , his demonic voice echoing across the vast chamber , the deep sound reverberating across the skulls and bones cast around the ground . The naked boy looked up , `` I am lord Timmothy the fearsome ! take this fiend , hiyah ! '' The boy whacked Eradicus on the ankle again with his toothpick of a sword . Eradicus let out a pained sigh , sounding akin to a raging furnace letting out swathes of steam . Eradicus tried his best to do a smile , assuredly making numerous puppies die somewhere at the sheer terror of the event . `` Timm- Lord Timmothy the fearsome , I have something to resolve at the current moment , so can we please continue this later ? '' . Timmy stopped whacking Eradicus 's ankle , `` Hmmmmmm ... You may have the great Timmothy 's mercy this once fiendish fiend ! But I will stay here until you are finished ! '' . Eradicus sighed once more , going back to mentally reassuring himself . `` Do you have any games ? or a phone I can borrow ? '' asked a shrill voice from the corner of the room . Eradicus turned his 500 tonne body to look the source of the question in the eye . `` I do not have any games , I am a demonic undergod can you not see ? Please let me concentrate child '' . Timmy let out a huff and started pouting in the corner , before whacking one of the hellguards on the toe with his wooden sword . The hellguard looked uncomfortable , but as it lacked any organs or vocal cords in its skeletal frame , it was unable to ask the boy to stop . Eradicus gave the hellguard an empathetic look , before going back to switching on the boss room runes . Being an undergod just was n't worth it anymore .
Blood drips red onto the floorboards , seeping through the dark mahogany . "
" Her eyes , glassy yet dim , like a lightbulb that needs to be changed . "
" My lips , bloody and gashed as I rip through flesh and sinew . "
 Flesh . Muscle . Bone . Marrow . Nothing goes to waste . 
 Each mouthful is a delicacy . Each bite is more desperate than the last . 
" I savour the taste of her liver , the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth . "
" Her body twitches still , the last remnant of life seeping out of her . I relish it . "
" I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like , her uterus , the traces of urine in her bladder ... But not now . "
" Beside her , a phone screen lights up , a single text message catches my eye . "

 `` Please do . ''

" Their faces are contorted in agony but I could barely tolerate eating either one completely , as their extremities in weight caused the feasting experience to suffer . "
 As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath . A whisper . A quiet whimper from the girl . 
 Impossible . 
 I set to rummaging about the house for a mop to clean up the mess as I wait for my next course to arrive . 
 I whistle while I work . I even sing a little . 
 Imagine if this funny pattern where to just keep repeating itself .

National Parks are a beautiful part of any nation . Yellowstone in the USA , Parque La Huasteca in Mexico , Krka in Croatia - all of them are filled with jaw dropping sights , unique in their spirit but unified in the effect they have on the observer . Spend a night observing the stars under the black skies of Snowdonia and the next night you spend in your apartment or McMansion will feel strangely crowded . "
" Each culture around the world shares stories about the woods , usually depicting animals that can speak , secret cultures of elves or dwarves that refuse to live with man , or trees that are wiser than even the most learned man . But each culture also shares the same story , the one that warns a wanderer not to stray from the cleared paths in the forest . The French have Little Red Riding Hood , the Germans have Hansel & Gretel , A Vava Inouva from Algeria , Lon Po Po from China ; all of them share a similar theme of warning the listener to beware whatever waits just beyond the trees . "
" Have you ever read the original journals of Lewis and Clark ? You probably have n't , there 's a reason we remember them , but not a single quote from either has permeated the American national consciousness . Clark was a syphilitic , a disease which was believed to cause madness in its later stages , and Lewis fell in love with the dried Peyote roots that the Natives were so eager to trade for cloth and rifles . Their America is a different one from the one we know , a land filled with awful beasts that hunted man for sport . There is one who they describe in depth , a pale bony creature that walks upright like a man with long clawed hands that drag along the dirt , leaving a trail along the deep imprints left from hooked feet . "
 They called it a wendigo . 
" The creature appears throughout their writing , in every state they crossed through , they both wrote of scared natives who refused to lead them down easier paths , saying that these lands were where the wendigo lived . They ignored their guide once , preferring the easier crossing that a forested valley provided over hiking over another mountain , they turned back after the third skeleton they found with the jaw removed and the skull crushed in . I 've read before that any animals that eats a man will eat the body in the following order : the thighs , the glutes , the fat deposits on the front of the belly , the tongue , and the brain . Lewis and Clark noticed that these people seemed to have died in reverse order , the teeth marks rarely were on the thigh bone or the tailbone , but they were always on the skull . "
" The strangest part about having your brain eaten is that you 're alive for longer than you 'd expect . Your brain is filled with redundancies for the major functions , it 's the reason brain damage can cost you the ability to speak or to regulate your emotion , but your heart will keep beating . Cannibals used to believe that eating a man 's brain gave you his power . There would be festivals where a man had his head placed through the center of a table , exposing only the top of the scalp . The flesh and bone would be removed with an obsidian blade , and as the sacrificed screamed underneath the table , high priests and kings would dig into their meal with polished stone spoons . I have heard before that people taste rather like pigs . "
" Lewis and Clark only saw the wendigo once , while they were traveling by torchlight through the green woods of western Oregon . They said they could n't hear it , but that it appeared in the shadows of the trees , a tall and gaunt beast that would have blended in with the branches if it was n't moving . It followed them for the full night , disappearing when they shouted and banged their pans and shot at it , but reappearing every time . The party did n't sleep until long after dawn broke , and even then , a member disappeared . They could have followed him , the screams let them know exactly where he was , but courage escaped them and eventually the noise stopped . "
" There have been periodic sightings of wendigos ever since . I am sure if you have any friends living west of the Mississippi , they all know someone who can speak of the shadow that moved beyond the trees , waiting . Officially , the United States government says that 11 people went missing without a trace in the woods last year . Many believe that number is much higher . "

The biting wind whipping across the permafrost sought out the crack between my gloves and sleeves . “ I hate it here , ” I muttered . "
" “ Well , next time , Xander , ” Sasha said on the radio , “ don ’ t volunteer to assist the professor , *who is a climatologist* study the effects of environmental erosion. ” "
" *Damn , didn ’ t realize my radio was keyed . * I tugged on my sleeve , trying to cover the gap in my clothing . A popping sound beneath me made me freeze in place . *Oh , shit . * The permafrost gave way , and I was falling into darkness . "

 “ Xander ! Xander ! Can you hear me ? ” Sasha screamed over the radio . 
" I groaned and rolled onto my side . “ Yeah , ” I croaked into the mic . "
" “ Xander ! Are you there ? We can ’ t pick up your transponder . If you can hear me , say something ! ” "
" “ Damn , ” I muttered . I sat on my knees and looked around the defile . It was too dark to see anything , and I cracked a chemlight , holding it high as the plastic tube brightened my surroundings . “ Fuck , where am I ? ” My words curled into a fog in the freezing air . "
" The sheer sides of the crevice looked like they would offer no purchase if I tried to climb up them . “ How far did I fall ? ” The sky was a dim crack in the distance , but the defile seemed to continue for a distance . “ May as well follow it ... Maybe there ’ s a better place to climb out down that way. ” "
" I walked a few feet and caught my foot on something hard , losing my balance and slamming my face into the freezing earth . I touched my left hand to my nose , and my white glove came away with dark red blood . *Pay more attention , damn it . * A humming sound to my left drew my gaze to a glowing pair of blue eyes encased in the dark ice . "
" I dropped the glow stick and edged away from the lights . The light landed next to a large metal finger . The ground shuddered beneath me , and ice broke away from the crevice ’ s wall . A large metal arm shot out from the ice , blocking a large boulder from crushing me . Melted ice hissed away from the shiny metal monstrosity rising from the permafrost . "
" “ Cvlz drksht valdir , ” the metal giant screeched . "
 “ Don ’ t kill me ! ” I yelled . 
" “ Kuldir fyr volstur ! ” The machine made no more movements , but the blue eyes did not move . "
" I held still , waiting for the thing to crush me . *I think if it wanted to , it would have all ready . * “ What do you want from me ? ” "
" “ Scan of temporal lobe complete . Language assimilated . Indigenous life from , state your designation. ” "
 “ I ’ m Xander Roberts . What ’ s your… designation ? ” 
" The machine withdrew its arm from above me . “ Multi-Vector Combat System , codename Maverics . My pilot ’ s life signs have ceased . System is unable to function without organic pilot . AI will be deleted permanently to prevent damaged functions to developing if a new pilot is not located. ” "
 “ Okay . What do you want me to do ? ” 
" The machine ’ s head cracked open , and a desiccated mummy tumbled out . “ Enter the cockpit. ” <newline>
They used to tell me that there is no such thing as magic . Well , I can tell you right now that magic is real . Okay , it is n't actually magic , but the quantum-mechanical mumbo jumbo is so confusing that it might as well be . Reading a book on the particular quantum funkiness that changed my life is harder than translating a Latin version of the Necronomicon . All I wanted to know was how to control it . "
" It started in the summer of 2009 . At first , it just seemed like a lot of strange coincidences were happening around me . It was little stuff , like finding a 20 $ bill in my pocket whenever I wanted beer or receiving a phone call from someone at the same moment I happened to be thinking about them . Then , things got even crazier . "
" Whenever I found myself wanting something , it would immediately appear . I would hear a loud screeching sound and turn around to find the object of my desire hovering in the air before me . It only worked with inanimate objects at this point , so it would usually be food , drinks , shit like that . It even worked with electronics . That was the best part . Having whatever I wanted , when I wanted it . "
" It was fun for a while , having everything I could ever want . I did n't even question where these things were coming from . I assumed it was magic . It was n't until I figured out how to conjure living things that I started to wonder how this was even possible . That particular skill was discovered while drunkenly lamenting over the fact that I lived alone . No pets , no roommates , no family . I started thinking about how awesome it would be to have a dog , even picturing the type of dog . A fluffy golden Labrador Retriever , with a blue collar . "
" Sure as shit , that damn dog appeared right in my apartment ! I could n't believe it , I checked to see if any windows and doors were open . All closed . I returned to the living room to find the dog nestled into a pile of blankets on the couch . I shrugged and went back to watching television . The next day , I conjured up a leash and took the dog for a walk . While he was pooping , I found myself staring at a picture that had been stapled to a telephone poll . It was a picture of a lost dog . The same dog that was now pooping in front of me . "
" The realization hit me like a gun-shot . I had n't been conjuring things , I had been summoning them ! So I called the number that was listed below the picture , and returned the dog to his proper owners . I made up a lie to explain away how I came to be in possession of their dog , and they believed it . Next , I considered trying to return or donate the electronics , but I could n't figure out a way that would n't make it look like I was a professional burglar . "
" For the next several days , I struggled to keep myself from wanting things as I did as much research as I could to find out what the hell was wrong with me . My search led me to a bunch of books about quantum mechanics . I was n't smart enough to understand any of them . I remember wishing that my ability allowed me to summon a higher IQ . "
" So I gave up . There was no controlling this thing . No stopping it . I was able to avoid summoning any more living things , but inanimate objects were still popping up left and right . I eventually came to accept that I was doomed to be a quantum-burglar for the rest of my life . Hey , at least I did n't have to worry about getting caught .

It had latched onto me , but for whatever reason , it would not kill me .

He sat on the sidewalk , watching people enter and exit the door before him every few minutes . No one really paid him any attention , maybe because he and his coat were covered in dirt . But , that 's the way life was when you did n't have a home . Cleanliness did n't matter as much as satiating your hunger , and there was certainly food to be had beyond this door . "
" There did n't appear to be anything special about the door or even the building . It looked similar to the rest of the buildings on this street . But there was something different about it . Most notably , when the door opened , delicious scents filled his nostrils . "
" A couple and their child emerged from the door and walked down the street . The door stayed open for half a second before it started to close again . During that time , he was hit by a tidal wave of scents that sparked his hunger and summoned saliva . Spiced meat , potatoes , greens , oh he could almost taste it ! The excitement the smells inspired brought him to his feet . Surely someone would come outside with extra food ? Perhaps they would see him and share their bounty ? The thought made his mouth water more . "
 He had to get in there . 
" The door had already closed again by now , but he knew it would n't be long before someone else exited or entered , leaving the door open briefly . So he waited , imagining the luxurious edibles that would soon be available to him . He looked down the street and saw a father and his daughter approaching him and the door . New patrons , perhaps ? The little girl , bundled up in her coat , waved to him and smiled . He returned her enthusiasm as the father opened the sacred door , ushering his daughter inside . This was it . This was his chance . "
 He dashed inside before the door closed behind him . 
" The smell of the restaurant was so much more intoxicating when you were inside ! Overcome by excitement and the prospect of food , he sprinted through the building , driven by hunger . "
 `` What the ... '' someone began to yell . `` Get that dog out of here ! '' 
" But it was too late . Dashing around corners and under tables , the golden retriever found the source of the scent , stood on his hind legs , and grabbed a delicious tenderloin steak from a surprised patron 's plate .
By god , the girl was stunning . I could n't believe that she was interested in a normal fellow like me . It was almost too perfect - she slipped and I caught her . Romance ensued . She was so easy to be with and we striked up a conversation . Akward as I am I started imagining how our life would be together . We would have adorable little children , a puppy , and ... yea , I tend to get a bit over excited about things in general . "
" It was a good thing too that I got some good out of today . Earlier I was approached by a man . He looked quite ordinary except also a bit strange : he looked a bit harsh in his appearence . Judging from his cloth I assumed he was off after a long day at work . I thought nothing more to it until he came a bit too close . His breath was horrible and when I asked him to step out of my comfort zone he merely grunted in response . I am not a man of confrontation but I reached out my arm to regain personal space . The approaching man snatched it and before I could reclaim it he bit me . Hard , too ! Reactionary I let out an `` ouch '' and pulled my hand back . I quickly ran away from him at this point . Again , I am not confrontational . "
" Ever since the man bit me I have been a bit off . But being with the pretty lady really distracted me from this . As we walked in the park and talked a bit I noticed that she was a bit wary . Weirdly she also kept looking at the sky . What really confused me was when the clouds made a small hole , just small enough for the moon to peak out . At this point she was visibly tense and exclaimed to herself : `` THAT 'S TODAY ? '' "
" Of course I asked her what she meant but she was too preoccupied with her sorrundings . I felt so irrelevant and contemplated going back to the weird man so he could finish the job or at least tell him to `` bite me '' . This was of course a joke . Before I could manage to chuckle at my own joke I was interrupted by the lady . `` HIIISSH ! '' she sounded just before a harry man jumped on me . I did n't get to see him . It was dark and it happened so fast . Non the less the lady somehow managed to fight him off , all the while I lay confused and still non confrontational about anything . "
 When the harry man fled I was shooked but got on my feet . `` Did anything happen ? '' the lady asked me . I answered that I did n't think so and that is was a good thing since I had already been bit once today . She seemed surprisingly calm and laughed a bit about the situation . 
" A few minutes later we got back to my place . Romance intensified and I leaned in for a kiss . She dodged my attempt but took me closer . She then proceeded to whisper in my ear : `` I 'll show you a bite '' , as she sunk her fangs into my neck . I knew I was in a bad spot but something about the lady was so enchanting that I did not fight her . Actually , it felt great . "
" I just wanted her to continue but she stopped almost immediately . `` WHO BIT YOU EARLIER ? '' she demanded . `` Just some weird tired guy , probably a bit coo-coo after too much office time . '' I replied . she continued : `` Motherfucker . Now I also crave flesh . '' "
" She then left me . I still do n't get anything . One thing is for sure . I feel super weird now . It is like I am not me . I almost feel inclined to confront everyone I meet . Also I have started to get more harry . I have killer bangs now but I just wish that I would n't get *that* harry all over my body . I also started grunting more ... It 's weird . My dog just feels so enticing all of a sudden . But hey , maybe it is just a phase . "
