# Detect GPT-Generated Text with BERT
## Overview
This project utilizes a BERT-based model to detect whether a given piece of text is generated by GPT or written by a human. The primary goal is to leverage BERTâ€™s natural language understanding capabilities to identify the distinctive features of GPT-generated text.
## Features
**Text Classification**: Classify text as either GPT-generated or human-written.
**Pre-trained Model**: Use a BERT-based model fine-tuned on a dataset of GPT-generated and human-written text.
**Installation
**
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
**sh**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/detect-gpt-text-bert.git
cd detect-gpt-text-bert
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dependencies**
This project relies on the following Python packages:
transformers: For BERT and other pre-trained models.
torch: PyTorch, the deep learning framework used.
scikit-learn: For additional machine learning utilities.
numpy and pandas: For data manipulation.

**Data**
The dataset used for fine-tuning and evaluation consists of labeled examples of GPT-generated and human-written prompts. You can create your own dataset or use publicly available datasets.
